christmas-time and around here it s serious cookie-baking season i really didn t want to use a handmixer from now on so we bit the bullet and bought a wonderful kitchenaid mixer the one i bought has a

hard anodized quart saucier with lid is an excellent large multi-use pan from the original line of calphalon cookware the professional hard anodized line is very durable as long as one does not use

do get hot to the touch and one will need to use thick potholders in order not to get burned most saucier pans have curved bottoms but this pan has straight sides like one would find on calphalon

my first calphalon pan i purchased it primarily to use as an egg and breakfast fare pan i wanted a good non-stick pan because most of my other pans are stainless steel i consider it a very good buy for the price it has a very attractive design and the interior non-stick cooking surface appears to be very durable however the pan is slightly heavy and slow to reach the proper temperature compared to stainless steel the manufacturer s enclosed brochure says the slow warm-up is due to the non-stick surface true of most non-stick pans once it arrives at the required temperature it performs very well this aluminum pan is the equivalent of a permanently seasoned cast iron griddle it produces foolproof omelets and the food never sticks i use it to warmup chicken breasts and make grilled sandwiches too it is the most used pan in the house because of my passion for eggs this product like a few other calphalon products i have examined slipped past the quality control inspector on my pan there is an interior area smaller than a grain of rice that was not sprayed with the non-stick coating it is high enough on the pan where no one will ever cook on that spot but it is there in plain sight the lack of quality control may have something to do with the calphalon pans being manufactured in third world countries no offense intended this pan is made in china you would probably not have any trouble forgiving the stray blemish especially when you consider this pan s beauty functionality and price here is my list of pros and cons for this purchase pros good price excellent non-stick surface appears to be very durable too excellent stain resistant exterior cool comfortable handle attractive appearance lifetime warranty cons slow to warm up because of the non-stick surface fairly heavy pan you won t flip anything without a spatula think griddle quality control at calphalon could be better the handle is beautiful but the finish on the handle and rivets are not as refined as some of the more expensive cookware brands however it has no impact on the cooking conclusion excellent pan for the price', 'calphalon c1210p'], 9: ['i bought this a few months ago at a time when i

pretty much only use the humidifier at night and on the settings i generally use it goes through about of a full container of water it takes but a few minutes to refill and i do it before i go to bed at night the cleaning also doesn t take very long even in a household with hard water the pamphlet suggests a minute soak in a vinegar water solution while it was soaking i spray clr onto the heating element and used a toothbrush to scrub i ve also soaked it in a solution of clr and water or used some of the vinegar water solution you may need a little bit of elbow grease but by the time i was done the minutes was about up minimal wiping was needed for the tray i too am busy but i was easily able to find minutes to clean the humidifier the pamphlet also suggests sitting the machine on a tray or something similar however i have mine sitting right on the carpet next to my bed i ve experienced no leaking or spills whatsoever i do agree that something beyond little dewdrops for the humidity control would be helpful but i ve set mine in the middle and have found that be just fine in either the high or low setting i suppose it could be problematic if someone is running the machine or needs a room to be at a specific humidity level however that is not an issue in my case also because i only run the machine at night and it s not cranked all the way up i have not had any

inexpensive yet equally functional alternative to the very expensive pots pans note recently farberware reduced its quality in that older farberware pots pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell the newer pots pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom but not encased within a stainless steel bottom so their quality is less than it was most people who grew up with farberware may not realize this farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base curve up the side of the pan they no longer do this and are the

that the water tank lasts for hours it may last a day or so on the lowest setting but on higher settings which you may not need it will only last hours it turns itself off the humidifier turns off but the fan stays on it s pretty quiet when the water gets too low it will leave a wet spot on the floor in front of it but i just point it at the radiator and the heat from the radiator takes care of any dampness that might appear i do this on the theory that heating the mist will help saturate the air with moisture i m not sure if it does or not but that s my theory and i m sticking to it the light is kinda neat it ll cast a blue light on the ceiling if you turn the light on and when the water drops giving that typical humidifier gurgling sound the light on the ceiling shimmers it s worth about minutes of entertainment on the first night you own it i don t have particularly hard water where i live but it does leave a bit of a crust on the radiator minerals probably i just wipe it with a damp cloth if you have hard water where you live you may want to use filtered water as recommended plus there s a bit of scale that builds up which is normal for any humidifier but cleaning it is relatively easy with the included brush that stays with the base you can t submerse it in water because of the fan but you can fill it with water in the shower for cleaning just so long as you keep it angled away from the fan after a few days the previously smooth radiator had a rough feeling to it but if you dampen your fingers with the mist coming out of the humidifier you ll see it wipes right off but i point it directly at the radiator electric radiator so this is sort of an extreme case use filtered bottled water if you think this will be a problem regarding the other comment about having to flip the tank over to fill it that s how all humidifiers are except for the hot steam ones the top is clear molded plastic and not strong enough to fit the cap plus the mechanism depends on the vacuum in the bottle keeping the water in there it works on the same principle as those soda bottle cat water dishes you can try this at home take any soda bottle fill it with water and then put it over a soup bowl do this in the sink because it will splash but once the level of water in the bowl covers the bottom of the soda bottle the water will stop coming out defying gravity raise the bottle a bit and water will come out but only until the bottom is covered again a previous humidifier i had had the handle on the bottom and the top which was nice and made it easier to fill but this humidifier is so much smaller that i can see why they only have the handle at the top yes there s a constant running water noise that can be disconerting it gets louder on the higher settings but you get used to it if you don t think you ll get used to it don t get this humidifier i think better engineering could have somehow mitigated this sound but it really doesn t bother me anymore okay on to the rest of the review the whole ultrasonic mechanism is pretty cool there s a metal plate that vibrates and sends water into the air the fan blows the air up a chimney and a little dial at the top that lets you direct the mist in any direction you want the dial also lets you open it close it to different degrees which is how you control the intensity mist floats up about feet into the air before dissipating returning to the floor hopefully more of it dissipates than reaches the floor but there will be a damp spot on the floor unless you did as i do and point it at the radiator i was tempted to use a fan to blow the mist over the rest of the room but that seems to defeat the purpose wouldn t a fan blowing cool mist cool off the room more than you want in the winter pointing it at the radiator works great the mist is visible and if you remove the cap you feel like you can make a science fiction movie it s that kind of effect on the higher settings if you close the door dew will appear on the windows in a few hours on the higher settings it can get pretty misty feeling in the room like on a cool summer morning or during a fog or like a sauna if it s warm for a while i was afraid that it was too misty and i d get a sore throat but now we use it only on the lower settings and it s great it adds just the right amount of humidity for my x x room with the door closed i left it off the other night and woke up with my nose completely dry i hadn t realized how much of a difference it made until that point plus the cats love it it really is an entertaining little blue thing the mist is a lot of fun to play with the wicking humidifier was a pain the wicks only lasted a week or two before it needed to be replaced and there was a constant fight against bacteria i would take this humidifier over the wicking one any day the wick was a x x pad that brought the moisture up a fan ran over it to distribute the moisture into the air this one is easy to clean and has no wick and is extraordinarily entertaining stars as a humidifier easing the winter dryness and for causing a wet spot on the floor star for being so darn entertaining and easy to use star for initial cost cheap maintenance cost free water and relative ease of maintenance i d recommend this humidifier to anyone there s a humidifier on amazon that costs or times as much and i just don t see how if it s an ultrasonic humidifier it can be that much better it s the same mechanism maybe it adds a hygrometer or some fancy device but you don t really need it just set the level with the dial i might pay more for quieter or holds more water but not times more save your money or buy of these for your big house', 'sunbeam ultrasonic'], 58: ['how did i exist before my chocolate fondue fountain quite frankly i

i ve owned that did not drip outside the cup while coffee was being poured i now enjoy pouring a cup of coffee without having to hold both cup and pot over the sink to avoid a mess on the counter or pouring so slowly that a valuable chunk of my life is sacrificed in the process i found the cuisinart manual informative and easy to follow the initial set-up process was not difficult some reviewers griped about the cost of replacing the charcoal water filter pleaseif you buy a set of filters from cuisinart the cost is less than each a set of will set you back each if a filter lasts through approximately pots of coffee that small expense is hardly a drawback filter use while suggested is optional so take comfort misers of the world someone who balks at the cost of replacing the charcoal water filter is an unlikely owner of this particular coffee maker there are cheaper models but remember in most cases you get what you pay for this unit is worth the price other reviewers griped that the digital clock is difficult to read if i stand in front of the coffee maker i can read and set the time on its digital clock without strain back-lighting might be better but it is a minor point i haven t owned the cuisinart long enough to test the self-cleaning feature or the cup brewing setting nice to know that both are available the toggle on-off switch is retro but handy and suits the design of the unit as a whole i appreciate the reminder of soft beeping when the brewing cycle is complete and when the warmer plate shuts off i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate i set mine at low and find that keeps the carafe s contents piping hot a terrific safety feature is the automatic shut-off of the warming plate the timing of which can be chosen by the user no more shutting off too soon or too lateor if forgotten not at all clean-up is easy the pot lid pops off with the flick of a finger even though the carafe is tall it fits nicely on the top rack of my dishwasher the filter and its basket slide out of the coffee maker for washing and back in without a struggle a reviewer commented that the filter capacity was insufficient seems fine to me this is a tall coffee maker i measured mine at that gives me clearance from my upper kitchen cabinet the unit is not so heavy that i had any difficulty sliding it under the cabinet or pulling it out for use some reviewers disliked the small opening through which water for brewing is poured i am not tall but i can see the right spot and have had no trouble filling the reservoir thanks in part to the dripless pot as for the internal hard-to-see water level indicator who cares don t you look at the water level in the pot before you add water to the coffee maker why would anyone need to check this twice my only gripe is as others did note the internal condensation on the lid of the water reservoir true there s a significant amount some of it does dribble down the back of the coffee maker when the lid is opened towards the electric cord at the base of the unit right above the cord is a curved piece of plastic that protects the cord unit interface from bumps and presumably from the drops of condensation this glitch is new to my experience i dug out my old coffee maker competitive brand and took a look at the pertinent engineering when its reservoir lid is opened a piece of plastic built into the rear of the lid directs any condensed droplets back into the reservoir itself the cuisinart lacks this feature when the cuisinart s reservoir lid is opened it tilts away from the unit giving condensation nowhere else to run but out and down towards the electric cord i cope by using a paper towel to catch the initial drops after which i wipe the inside of the reservoir lid to remove the remaining condensation mildly annoying but not enough to ruin my appreciation of this coffee maker overall i give this coffee maker stars bravo great-tasting coffee from a smart attractive machine all it needs is a more visible digital clock minor issue and re-engineering to eliminate external drips from condensation when the reservoir lid is opened thank you cuisinart', 'dcc-w'], 64: ['i received

coffee every single day in our house and it can be doubled if we have guests we are hard on any machine just due to the amount of use this machine just keeps on brewing and frothing the stainless steel carafe is a winner also and we don t have any problem with the coffee temperature it s perfect the frothing parts are easily clogged up rather than get obsessive about washing every part after every pot we keep a glass of hot water next to the machine and just keep the parts soaking in the glass which keeps the milk deposits from setting the coffee is good and strong chewy if you like it

two the mixer is good for doing an occasional bread recipe and for other light tasks like whipping cream mixing mashed potatoes etc but if you use it to make heavy or dry breads on a regular basis it isn t suitable when i first received the machine i loved it i liked the high quality metal construction the provided attachments and the reputation of the kitchenaid name throughout the first year i had no trouble with it i used the machine once every month or so i tried a few of the loaves of bread from the included recipe book i really enjoyed the machine and it is quite powerful for its rated watts then i bought this wonderful book the bread baker s apprentice by reinhart only then did i realize how woefully inadequate this machine is for medium use i started baking bread once a week from a lighter ciabatta to heavy whole wheat breads and bagels the machine vibrates so much while mixing breads that i am afraid it is going to fall on the floor the pin holding the tilt head on also works its way out one of these days i am afraid it will fall out and the mixer head will fall off while mixing dry doughs like bagels the motor strains so hard that it sometimes stops for second at a time and makes buzzing noises before it finally is able to knead the dough this causes excess heat in the motor that i am sure will cause premature failure it has the electrical burn smell afterwards in the last few months the machine has quickly declined and it is on its last limb it is only a matter of time before the motor burns up or the gearbox fails when it does fail i will probably fix it and keep it around as a meat grinder since it has the power take off unit that can run the meat grinder attachment one of the nice things about these mixers is they are completely serviceable but i will replace it with a delonghi kenwood dsm7 that is better suited for my kneads pun intended as i said this mixer is excellent for light use and for a single loaf or small loaves of bread at a time if you intend to bake bread frequently it would be wise to invest in something heavier duty if i only used it for light use i would have rated it a', 'classic watt'], 89: ['it really works just plop it on

goal was to have a toaster oven that could toast at least four slices of bread if not six and also one that could toast more than two halves of a bagel at one time we also wanted a toaster that was an oven too for reheating pizza or baking a small amount of food rather than always having to use our large oven we had owned a delonghi toaster oven in the past and liked that it is larger some of the toaster ovens on the market are so tiny that they might fit one small slice of pizza only or two slices of bread to toast i looked to the internet and amazon to reserach this before making a decision first the customer reviews here were helpful but sometimes left me more confused i was worried about some of what i read about the complaints that the product not being able to do certain functions but other customer reviews didn t state the same things we took a chance and bought this model from amazon and found that if a person actually reads the directions then yes it does the functions that some customers claim it does not it appears some people were using the toast function to bake and complained about that that is obviously not the right way pro s and con s it looks sleek due to the brushed silver color but it is plastic just know that i don t know if this will bother you or not i don t like that this brand s method of toasting requires turning a dial and hearing a constant tick-tick-tick sound it drives me nuts no one else in the family gives a hoot about that though the toast does take longer to toast compared to a different brand of toaster oven a relative owns and compared to our old broken stand-up toaster this does hold at least four halves of bagels which is good smaller bagels that are crammed in can fit six halves bagels have to be set to nearly the dark setting to get any amount of toasting onto them and they seem to take a very long time to toast there is no timer so for example if you bake something you have to use a separate timer the heat setting goes to so that is good for reheating pizza quickly and for baking frozen chicken nuggets i do find that baking times take a bit longer than the heating directions on packages minutes total for frozen chicken nuggets not for example it is large sized and that is helpful for families who eat meals together there are plenty of other models by other companies that are more suitable for making toast or baking food for one or two people lastly it has a very convenient pull-out tray that catches the crumbs which makes disposing of the crumbs very easy on month of using it ours just quit working according to my husband who investigated it the problem is the electricity from the outlet was not getting to the oven somewhere along the path we checked the outlets to make sure they were functional we don t know where the problem is but it is shot it has a one year warrantee so this is destined for the trash or for freecycle honestly we d hoped this would have lasted longer than months i swear we are becoming more and more of a disposable society and they just don t make things like they used to i am torn about how to rate this toaster oven due to the various pro s and con s and the fact that ours died on month overall for the high price compared to other toaster ovens on the market i d have thought it would have lasted longer than months so i ll give it a rating of a as overall

this might be a good thing any results i ve had that were less than ideal were due to beginner error i added a tbsp water not realizing the machine had finished the kneading process one time and this resulted in slightly raw in the middle which is exactly what the machine booklet said would happen also i had used the rapid bake option with that loaf and one other which leaves a little less room for error the machine is quiet and doesnt try to jump off the counter which i read could happen with some machines maybe if they are lighter weight this machine is hefty i would guess lbs or so and isnt going anywhere i m having fun using the machine and trying different recipes i bought the bread machine magic recipe book at the same time vol one revised edition and have tried different recipes

the respected scientist and author robert wolke since i eat a lot of raw fruit and salads i was interested because of all the news stories about contaminated produce and in our industrialized food chain a contaminated batch from one farm infects a huge amount of food so intrigued but not in a rush to spend i read thru all the posted reviews and comments to reviews since a company spokesman leaves comments especially on negative reviews so why am i adding another to the pile there are a few things nobody else has mentioned that i think are worth knowing before buying this unit the most important thing of course is does it work i m not a biologist so i can t offer a professional opinion as to germ killing but it clearly to me seems to be doing something plain water doesn t for example after a dinner with wine if the glasses dry out there is a red film left that water and even soap don t easily remove but a spray of the tersano-treated water and it dissolves away it also seems to kill mold and dissolves grease splattered on the stove but you ve read about cleaning elsewhere here are the new observations first if you re planning on using this figure its going to take some extra time for example you come home with some fruit some lettuce and salad fixings the tersano comes with a large bowl for cleaning food but it might hold or apples so wash those then repeat with the next fruit then the lettuce stuff each cycle takes minutes to prepare the bowl water and then its supposed to sit for more minutes then drain dry and put the items away each cycle takes me minutes so i can spend minutes just getting stuff cleaned and put away granted its now clean and wasn t before so that s valuable but you should ask yourself if you re going to commit this time each time you bring home groceries to me it s worth it also while cleaning food its easy to end up with a bunch of bowls on your counter the tersano unit will tell you if the water isn t clean at the end of the cycle so you really need to rinse lettuce parsley etc well before using the unit its an eye-opener to find out how much dirt is in stuff that looks clean and that you ve just run under the tap which is how i used to clean greens before i find i need to dunk it in a bowl of water and swirl often bowls worth before the food is really clean and you ll probably want a salad spinner out too so you can dry the lettuce before putting it away otherwise it ll get moldy so that s another bowl on the counter in addition to the tersano unit bottom line is the unit really does sanitize food and you re putting it away clean but its taking some time and effort as for cleaning i really like that i can spray it around my kitchen and not worry about splattering any knives or things in the drying rack or on the sink in my bathroom without having to first move toothbrushes and so on read the label on cleaners and you ll understand why splatter isn t a good idea with chemical spray cleaners but again there s a catch the bottle of isn t that big and is right there under the sink with the tersano the ozone water only keeps for minutes so you need a fresh bottle each time you re going to use it it only takes the unit about a minute to prepare the spray bottle which is faster than the food bowl but the tersano isn t small so be sure your kitchen has room letting you put it somewhere where you can get to it quickly if you have to unstack and move a bunch of things you may be less willing to pull it out when you should be using it one bonus not mentioned in the literature is that the water seems to be purified by the machine so it doesn t leave spots when it dries i was spraying my sink and was quickly getting tired of drying the chrome faucet so i decided to just let it go to my surprise when the mist dried the chrome didn t have spots i m just using ordinary tap water that usually leaves spots so i m curious to hear if other people are getting spot-free drying also while the literature says it can replace harsher cleaners i tried it and it doesn t always work on some dirt spots the treated water didn t really allow them to come that clean even with some scrubbing but when i hit it with the spots dissolved right away this has only been in a few places most others the tersano water does a great job but i wouldn t throw away all your other cleaners until you ve found out whats going to work for you lastly if you look at the pictures on the amazon site they show it with a mesh holding the fruit under the water you need it because apples and other fruit tend to float lettuce bobs above the surface etc that mesh is not included with the unit you buy since i read thru the reviews i knew the company would send me one free if i called and they were really nice and did

crocker traditional original brownie mix and the nd time using a betty crocker chocolate chunk brownie mix the first time i found it a little difficult to pour the batter into the channels of the pan without getting it onto other parts of the pan the batter was thin enough that i thought i would be able to shake the pan and get it leveled out i eyeballed it and very carefully so as not to get batter up the sides of the pan moved some of the thicker areas of batter into the thinner areas although i thought i had it level as it was baking and rising i could see that i did not when testing for doneness i chose to bake long enough to get the thickest section done with the end result being that the thinner sections were too dry even my husband who thinks anything chocolate can t be bad thought they were too dry i removed them from the oven minutes before the minimum baking time per directions on brownie mix box the mix i used the nd time was far thicker than the traditional mix so everything that i found a little difficult before was times more difficult i worked and worked at getting it spread into all the channels determined to get the batter level this time i checked for doneness minutes before the minimum recommended baking time but they were not done until the exact minimum baking time per box directions this time they were not dry but the thicker sections were too gooey and underdone for my taste after reading all the good reviews and ordering it i had planned on buying more later to give as gifts to my daughter and my daughter-in-law now that i have used the pan a couple times and am finding it difficult to level the batter i have decided not to i don t really want to give a gift that requires warning the recipients of the problems they are likely to have with it right now i do think this pan bakes more evenly than traditional x or x pans i never use x pans for brownies but spreading the batter evenly is a pain i don t understand why none of the other reviews mention the problem of getting the batter even i will say the quality construction material of this pan is excellent i didn t grease the pan or use any cooking spray the nd time i used it and

the pan smaller not only do you get more edges on each brownie the unique construction of the pan makes it easier to serve the nonstick coating probably helps with serving for those that say they already have a brownie pan all i can say is that i took so long to purchase the pan because i also had a pan that would work for baking brownies it may have been an inch square or a x inch pan but it wasn t a brownie pan i worried about cleaning the pan but it s really not a problem i simply soak it in soapy water then wipe it clean i liked it so much i purchased another for my sister and i ll

register for a set for my wedding i have begun to cook a lot in the last few years but never had the guts to go out and just splurge on a great set for myself i had always used nonstick in the past so i was originally going to go with the contemporary nonstick set that is until i started reading about the health hazards which i had never realized when i decided that stainless seemed the healthiest way to go not to mention the smartest if i wanted to be able to make yummy pan sauces i decided to go with the contemporary stainless i immediately ruled out allclad because i could not justify asking people to spend that kind of money on me i saw the tri-ply set on websites but it never looked very appealing to me so i never paid it much attention i m not going to lie i wanted pans that would not only cook well but were nice to look at why not but one day i was in a local retail store and saw the triply set in person the pictures really don t do it justice they are beautiful with their sleek exterior and glass domed lids suddenly i started paying attention to these truly gorgeous pans when i compared the piece set to the piece contemporary it was pretty much a no-brainer for less you get more pieces that both cook equally well since they both contain a full aluminum core cooking with them has been an absolute joy they really do heat fast i have had to train myself to set the temperature loweri learned the hard way when i managed to burn chicken on barely over medium heat they also cook very evenly i really do taste the difference i particularly like the quart saucepan it comes in handy so much more than i thought it would when you make something that is too much for the ever-used qt but seems too little to have to drag out the big stockpot in my opinion the quart saucepan alone is worth buying this set over rarely if ever have i ever seen a set that inludes a quart saucepan with a helper handle that helper handle makes all the difference in the world believe me i really put these to the test when i tried scrambled eggs using one of the fry pans i kept the heat pretty low and let the butter heat up voila it may as well have been a nonstick pan that s how perfectly the eggs slid off i can t wait to try more and more recipes using these they are such a delight to cook with that i look for things to make every chance i can get i would recommend these hands down to anyone you re getting the same quality as allclad it s the exact same material and construction but so much more for your money plus they are beautiful to look at and they cook quickly evenly and wonderfully another thing that s nice not only about this set but with most calphalon cookware is that they give you that extra quart in all of the saucepans in a brand like allclad for example who makes saucepans in exact and quart increments you re actually able to cook less in the pot because there is no quart to allow you some extra cooking room if you re making something like a soup that requires quarts of liquid you ll need bigger than a quart pot unless you want soup spilling over the edges see what i mean in these saucepans you get that extra room in the potsjust another reason to add to the list why these pans are so fabulous the best part of all is that the cleaning is so easy in my opinion it hasn t been any harder to wash these than it is to wash non-stick barkeeper s friend has really been a lifesaver after my chicken burning incident my pan had a whitish film all over it that was very unattractive a few circular strokes with a damp cloth and barkeeper s it looked brand spanking new again some might think that it s a lot of work to keep stainless steel clean and looking nice and that something like teflon is a lot more convenient convenient yes but if cooking and good tasting food is really what matters to you then a little extra polishing and cleaning now and then is a small price to pay for a true quality product like another reviewer said

machines abms over the last years and use them quite frequently i have found the bbccx20 to be the poorest abm to date though it costs twice as much as most of its competitors the ergonomics are poor it has a window to observe the bread but no light so i had to keep a flashlight handy to see the bread there is no breadpan handle this makes it difficult to remove the bread and occasionally results in minor but annoying burns when a mitt or pot holder slips kneading is not up to par with other abms the preprogrammed cycle times are such that minor changes in environmental humidity make for very large differences in loaf size bread density and crust development i found myself making ever changing adjustments to recipe water volume with the seasons while all abms require some seasonal humidity adjustment the bbccx20 cycles are overly sensitive and difficult to work around one of the paddles and its breadpan post has worn out and the machine no longer kneads dough even though the machine is still under warranty months it is not worth the effort and cost of sending the breadpan back to zojirushi for repair or replacement the quality of the dough and or bread made by the zojirushi is so

discontinued amazon removed the link so that means you ve heard about this toaster and you re looking to find out more about it ok let s continue there are over customer reviews on the braun ht600 as of this writing few of them go into much detail most just giving either a thumbs up or citing a few features liked a minority didn t like this toaster and gave some negative reviews mostly due to malfunction reasons introlet s face it a lot of appliance companies these days are making toasters that many people back in the s and s would consider junk back then toasters were solid well made appliances with simple controls usable by all but over time this changed today you go to wal mart and buy a ge toaster only to find that it really wasn t made by ge at all plus the appliance fails to perform consistently and for any reasonable period of time in short you wasted your money braun has a strong reputation in europe for usually making excellent appliances they are best known for their shavers well they tried their hand at making toasters and from what i could see they did a pretty good job of it the ht500 and ht550 were decent but had some reliability problems then they came out with the next model which ended up being their last enter the braun ht600 i selected this toaster because i was looking for a long single-slot toaster i e tandem one that can toast either two slices of bread or one very large slice of bread without cutting it beforehand i also wanted one that looked good with a brushed aluminum appearance that would compliment my other appliances formbraun took the approach of making a longer but slimmer profile toaster it measures tall long and wide so if you have counter space that won t accommodate a typical thick fat rectangular toaster this one is a great alternative the long sides are covered with attractive brushed stainless steel plates and is protected with durable heat resistant black parts on the far ends all of the controls are situated on one end the toaster cord is relatively short but can be configured to run out of either end of the toaster to suit your position requirements the underside also serves as cord storage allowing you to keep the cord neatly held with the unit when putting away for long term storage this toaster is relatively light just lbs so you can consider storing it out of the way and pulling it out for toasting duty when you need it if counter space is limited i keep mine on top of the toaster oven and then bring it down to the counter when i need it functionbraun is a minimalist company most of their devices have very simple controls nothing elaboratekind of like an ipod this toaster is no exception you basically have three main controls toast start stop bread lever and heat setting dial the interesting thing is that the toaster start button is accompanied by two more controls defrost and reheat so if you ve got frozen bread you want to toast you push start and then press the defrost what this does is initially start the toasting with a low heat setting enough to thaw out the bread without really cooking it after a few moments the thawing is done and the toaster starts the normal toasting process this helps ensure a better toasting result the reheat button is kind of like the defrost except it won t perform a full toastingjust enough heat to warm up the bread this is a very nice feature if your toast happens to finish a little ahead of your other food preparations this toaster has one very long slottwo slices are placed in tandem you could even fit three slices if they are narrow enough it s versatile unlike the smaller slots on your typical toaster the mechanism has the usual bread holding cage that collapses against the bread when the toast lever is lowered so that the bread is kept centered between the heating elements it will accommodate thicker slices even bagels one nice little feature not immediately realized is that if you have very small bread being toasted the lever can be raised up beyond the off position making it easy to reach those slices very few toasters have this thoughtful feature as with any acceptable toaster this one features a crumb tray it slides out from the end opposite the controls and has decent safeguards against accidental crumb droppings unfortunately there are some ledges inside near the bottom that can collect crumbs so you have to knock the toaster a bit so they fall into the collection tray when cleaning it performancegenerally this toaster works very well without a lot of flash and distractions when on there s a very large prominent red light displayed nothing else it operates quietly the heating elements in my unit are mostly uniform one is a little shorter thinner so toasting isn t perfectly uniform the defrost option does indeed work and so does the warming option my only complaint is that if you find that the heat setting wasn t enough and your toast comes out too light putting the bread back in requires you to turn the dial down a bit it won t dynamically sense how much heat is given off by the bread and pop early preventing too much browning the best thing is to watch the toast and be sure it doesn t go on too long but as with any toaster it will take a few runs before you get an idea of just how much toasting is done at each setting most brushed steel toasters get very hot on the outside the ht gets just slightly warm because the sides are well insulated but in any case the opposite ends sport enough heat resistant black plastic to allow moving the toaster right after use without requiring gloves there is an optional bun warming attachment rack but it is flimsy and bends if you re not careful if buying used be sure the seller packs the unit appropriately so this part doesn t get all bend out of shape some places still supply this as a spare part regardless it does work fairly well what you do is set the heating knob to the bun setting and then start the toaster with the rack in place put your buns on top of it and they ll be warmed up for serving in a few minutes truthfully it s not quite as effective as just zapping the bread in the microwave for about seconds or so however microwaving can make bread a little soggy this warmer won t do that a good combination would be about seconds of microwaving and then a few minutes on the bun warmer rack negativesno appliance is perfect but anything negative about this toaster would be very minor in comparison the cord storage doesn t account for the plug so the unit won t sit level you have to leave the plug dangling off to the side the brushed steel sides are attractive but can get scratched and or dented scratches are easily buffed out with some steel wool but not much you can do about dents the bun warmer attachment sits nicely on the top but when not in use it doesn t attach anywhere else on the unit it may get lost in time and lastly this unit is discontinued so there s no warranty or service possible overall it seems to be a well built unit so i expect it to last well past the money spent on it conclusionwith all of these great features in a beautifully designed body i can t understand why braun discontinued this product what a shame however there is hope of course e-bay is a resource for buying most anything and periodically these toasters come up for sale there some used and some brand new i picked up a new one for shipped compared to the price amazon had normally at one point they did conduct a sale for and a used one for hey it s a great toasterbest to have a backup just in case but be careful not to get caught up in a bidding war i saw a new one of these go for which i d consider a bit too much for this toaster it all depends upon how long you re willing

always keep fresh garlic on hand it s never expensive always delicious and hey i guess there are even health benefits to eating it right with this garlic press i don t wind up with stinky sticky stained fingers you don t even have to peel the garlic cloves i just put in a clove sometimes two if they re small squeeze clear off the pressed garlic with a table knife and use the same knife to clear out the peel that remains inside the press dumping it into the garbage or into my garden scraps it takes less than a minute to clean it up i just run hot water over the clove-holder part inside and out stick a little dish soap in there and open and shut the cleaner part under running water until it no longer foams from the soap or smells like garlic even with cleaning time i find this much faster than trying to peel and chop the garlic and clean the stink off my hands one word of warning don t let garlic residue set in this my son who s a great cook once used it without cleaning it immediately it took me forever to soak the garlic pieces out of all those little holes so we ahem had a talk and trust me it never happened again while he lived here but i m pretty sure immediate

while on vacation and found out how awful other garlic presses are in comparison to this one from what i ve read there are some garlic presses that others consider superior to this one it sounds like perhaps they push through a bit more garlic from what i ve seen they re also twice the price i think this oxo garlic press is fabulous one of the few kitchen gadgets that actually earn a place in my

able to tell that it was not a completely new product i used the large bowl with a number of blades and it functioned perfectly in every case i decieded to make some hummus in the small bowl and ran into an issue i dumped all the ingredients including two whole cloves of garlic into the bowl and turned the machine on it seemed to be functioning correctly but when i stopped to check both garlic cloves were virtually untouched i tried a couple of more times with the same result i noticed that there was a rather loud noise when the machine was running on closer inspection i found that the blade was not all the way down on the shaft the noise was the bottom of the blade striking the top of the garlic cloves i pushed the blade down and tried again this time i saw that the blade quickly rose about on the shaft high enough that it wouldn t cut the garlic perplexed i played with the blade to see if it would lock on the shaft but it would not i finally got the hummus made by running the machine and inserting a chop stick through the chute to push down on the top of the blade shaft this brought the blade down to where it would chop the garlic after i was finished i cleaned the machine and looked at the design in the main bowl the blade will lock on the shaft preventing it from rising when it s working unfortunately the same is not true for the small bowl there is no way to lock the small blade on the shaft and it s free to float upward this seems to be a design problem that could be fixed by kitchenaid it may be possible to fix this problem myself by twisting the blades slightly

owned more grind brew coffeemakers than the typical coffee addict this one is as good a grind brew machine as anyone makes first the negatives it is definitely loud and long in grinding as other

out the unusued coffee beans if you want to change blends to another bean though you can still put pre-ground coffee in the basket while there are beans waiting to be ground the carafe does tend to make a sort of cracking sound when it sits on the hotplate sometimes i have owned some of the most popular and some unusual grind brew machines in the past years including a very different capresso long long ago there are some models brands that only have a single grind possibility no settings some that require constant cleaning of parts some that fall apart within the year and don t have even that much warranty and one that was going to cost an extra to replace the faulty super-recessed lid switch which died after months without which it was totally unusable there s only one of those previous coffeemakers that i d buy again by choice and they stopped making it over years ago this capresso is well made nicely packaged and has all the features i want fineness of grind is controlled with possible settings amount of beans ground from the hopper that holds approx pots of beans is settable in cup increments from to cups aroma i e darkness flavor is controlled with settings which in combination with other controls seems designed to yield every possible preference for perfect coffee it has automatic shut-off one of the much-lower-priced grind brew machines doesn t have this feature which i think should be mandatory on coffeemakers considering how many fires are started by overheating appliances it has drip-trip which is critical as i often don t want to wait for the full pot to brew before i take a cup in the morning it s completely programmable not only can you set a start time but you can associate specific settings with the programmed time that are not the same as the current settings other pluses that are less quantifiable it doesn t seem to cause me to spill water all over the counter in filling it like the last one i had i have no idea what design elements affect this i just know that it happens with some coffeemakers not others it takes some parts in common with the other-brand grind brew that i last had which started leaking when brewing the charcoal filters and basket at the least seem in common with many other brands it cost quite a bit compared to some of the more popular models but frankly i m convinced it s worth the extra investment added

morning is the worst time to contact them despite the fact that i thought it was just past the warranty expiration when actually it was just before the end-date they were very helpful in getting it repaired at no charge and they paid all shipping both ways two weeks later i now have a like-new or new i m not sure which coffeemaker i have to admit that i had no idea just how hooked i was on the

it is still beating strong i decided to get my own but upgrade to the series so excited like a kid on christmas i used it last night for the first time i now have my own small time baking business so i am making cakes one after the next time is everything for me negative reasons without a tilt-head you need to remove the paddle to take the bowl out too timely for me and it is nice to lift the head and let the paddle drip back in the bowl cant do this with a bowl-lift feature putting the bowl back on you must check that the bowl is sitting correctly on the hinges again to much time with the tilt-head the bowl comes off and you can throw it back in very easily when turned on the motor makes a very annoying screechy sounding humm it annoyed me after about seconds could you imagine if i did a whole day of baking with it a high-pitched scratchy sound the old model had a regular hum nice when making identical cakes using the new mixer and my trusty old one guess which one was better yep the base model k90 mixer the series did not whip my eggs nearly as fast when set on the same speed after cakes i moved on to mixing dough for homemade gnocchi s instructions say to not go above speed with the dough hook i stayed on the stir level and the motor smelled like it was about to explode it was struggling bad not to mention the machine heated up hot to the touch you need to adjust it so the bowl and the paddle attachment are touching right from the box they sit about inch apart which will not mix bottom ingredients positives the color red was pretty2 the bigger bowl was nice but doubt if filled to capacity it would hold up i only had it filled half way i am very disappointed mostly because the motor overheated on the first day this thing wasn t cheap either my old k90 series was better all the way around i know the tilt head is my preference but there is no excuse for the engine to go after making one batch of gnocchi s i am returning this one and giving the th anniversary edition a go after calling kitchenaid to report the issue the operator was very condescending and rude and suggested that i only use kitchenaid approved recipes when making anything what

these issues and throws in a few extra benefits the is unobtrusive and far more aesthetically pleasing than a standard coffee maker its coffee dispense pedal makes distribution a snap however the space permitted between the base and dispenser makes larger cups a little more of an issue but achievable coffee preparation is just as easy as any carafe design and cleanup is certainly easier there

but whole wheat bread the machine became louder and louder each year and finally the gear worn out and the machine gave up mixing the dough when i posted this info online back then i received many responses saying that most people who love baking whole wheat bread at home use zojirushi because all others fail very soon because whole wheat dough is very though on the motor basically my first

the store-bought bread from the table and put mine on not a difficult trick to do with a good recipe zojirushi machine and a bit of experience when i bought this machine the new half sized lb machine didn t exist if it did i might have bought that one so that i can just keep baking fresh loaves without having to offer the stale slices to my roommates but then when it comes to going to parties i don t know if i would bother to bake one baguette at a time i like highly fragrant and chewy whole wheat bread i hate ones that are as light as a bag of air but i also don t like dense bread i think

kitchen knives and what not i strictly use it as a portable pocket style sharpener for taking on the road or trail its a little lacking for a home system and there are much better choices to be had

in itself to use and does a very nice job of putting a decent edge on just about any knife you may have along in the wilderness one doesn t really have to explain the good sense and value of having a knife along on a hiking trip its uses as a tool and for self defense is common sense on its fundamental level however i am often surprised at how many times i run into other hikers and campers who have enough good knives along but no sharpener for them at all its like they seem to forget that a knife can get just as dull at a campsite as it does in your kitchen on many occasions even a lot more so we all know full well what a drag it is using a dull knife no matter what job we are trying to perform i probably end up loaning out my smiths as much as i actually use it myself at around at the time of this writing it is certainly not something that will give your knives a shaving worthy edge but its ease of use and portability along with its price make it a solid performer and an excellent value i have had mine for about two years now and it is showing very little loss for the wear to be sure and i have probably used it several dozen times on everything from jackknifes to small camp

and so forth and every time i go looking at new cars i m amazed at how much the technology has advanced since my last purchase vacuum cleaners however don t advance quite that fast twenty years ago when i bought my house it came with an an old eureka bag vacuum a machine that was already at least ten years old but of a design that had been around since the s i used that machine for a good decade until i was seduced by the new high-tech looking bagless designs that were coming on to the market seduced by those dyson ads but not wanting ot pay dyson prices i bought a fancy looking eureka on sale and that machine has given me good service over the years with only a few filter and belt replacements i don t know that it actually cleaned any better than the old model but it looked great and it did have a hose and attachments which the old eureka didn t have emptying the dirt canister and washing the filters was more trouble and took a lot longer than simply swapping a bag on the old machine but at least i didn t have to keep bags on hand when i had the opportunity to evaluate a new panasonic i was curious to see if any real improvements had evolved in the world of vacuums since my last purchase my first reaction as i unpacked the machine from its box was that there were a lot of pieces and it wasn t clear how they all connected together a quick glance at the manual cleared that up and everything snapped or slid together easily i fired it up and took a tour of the wooden floors and rugs in my living room and dining room my first impression was that this was a pretty well engineered machine the extensible handle can be adjusted with the touch of a button and easily accommodates my frame no more stooping switching from carpet to hardwood floor is much easier than with my old eureka too as it requires only a light tap with the toe on the base of the machine changing over from floor cleaning to furniture walls drapes and so forth is much easier on the panasonic too on the eureka i had to bend over and detach the hose remove the two-part rigid extension from the other side of the machine assemble it attach it to the hose and lastly attach the cleaning attachment on the panasonic one simply detaches the handle from the top of the machine with or without the extension by choosing which release to push snap on a cleaning attachment and you re ready to vacuum the attachments include the usual crevice tool and a wider tool for general vacuuming plus a clever tool with an air-powered spinning brush designed for removing pet hair from upholstery i don t have any pets but i imagine this might also be useful for hard to reach bits of carpeting and carpeted stairs emptying the panasonic is much easier than emptying the bagless eureka too you simply lift a lever at the top of the canister and tip it forward no effort required disassembling the canister to empty it is no more complicated than on the eureka and it doesn t have the multiple pre-filters found on the eureka that require washing and drying every time you empty it panasonic claims that their cyclonic system does a better job of separating out light light particles too which means the hepa filter lasts longer between changes and there s something new to me a dirt sensor this is supposed to inform you when you ve removed at the dirt in a given area so you know when to move on by using optical sensors to detect whether particles are being sucked up in the airstream this is intended primarily for carpets and as i have mainly hardwood floors i didn t pay much attention to it while vacuuming all in all a very effective machine that s easy to use easy to empty and costs much less than some of the fancier bagless vacuums on the market that cost several times as much but probably don t clean any better i think the eureka will be retired to basement duty while the panasonic takes over the principle cleaning responsibility for my house update i had friends over for dinner last night and they noticed this unit and mentioned that they were looking for a new upright vacuum i immediately went into my sales spiel demonstrating the features i mentioned above how easy it is to extend the

minutes before using in cooking to allow time for the valuable compounds to develop once they have developed one should put the garlic into food at the last few minutes so heat will not destroy these compounds the general opinion is that one or two cloves a day is recommended for health now i crush a couple cloves with my new press mix them with a little olive oil sundried tomatoes and parmesian

cousin that lives in new england i have to edit my review being from the south i had no idea what new england hot dog buns were now i know you don t try to form rolls out of the dough you roll it out the size of the pan about an inch thick let it rise and bake the slab of dough that is in the pan when it is done remove it from the pan and then cut into buns then slice part way through on the top

fanatic about my cooking knives i like them to be true and razor sharp my old standby sabatier professional chef knives are starting to show their age so i ve been trying other designs to see what i like i ve read good things about ceramic knives and kyocera in particular so this was one near the top of my list to consider the knife itself came packaged as you d expect for a knife of this price point but when i took it out of the box i could tell i was in for a different experience of course the dark gray blade and damascus pattern is different but the knife was also quite a bit lighter in weight than i m accustomed to for this size blade i m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing but it feels very different in my hand it s certainly razor sharp and a glance under a high-power magnifier reveals a nearly perfect edge with no pits or ruts even after being used several times in comparison my conventional knives always show some slight pitting after use when examined this way the handle shape is a bit straight and square and i found it a little uncomfortable for my hand i like slightly wider and rounded handles with a bit more heft to them but this is a personal choice the blade itself is also a bit thick i m sure this is a byproduct of the ceramic design and no doubt it strengthens the knife protecting it from breakage if twisted only real complaint is that i found the finish of the handle a bit subpar for such an expensive knife there were bits of flash from the manufacturing process that i would have expected to have been polished smooth overall i like it and

smell different aromas it was quite nice i wasn t before but i am now a wine lover the vintage wines are specially better with the aerator the white wine aerator however as a reviewer stated seems to do essentially the same thing as the red wine aerator might be true but i ll leave it up to you in my opinion the taste in white wine changed as much as the red wine did with the red wine aerator now does this mean venturi is selling the same product under false advertisement i can t tell you becacause i m no expert and couldn t tell you other wise but i can tell you this both wine aerators used separately white red wine as i have do make a difference in wine taste and wine does taste smoother conclusion price wise if the aerators in fact do differ from each other then the price is just and this is a must buy for any wine drinker i personally did find that the taste was improved in both red and white wines just about the same plus the design overall of the aerators seemed to be exactly the same so i think venturi is basically selling the same aerator in different colours red white for the same end-result so save your money rinse and wash the red wine aerator then use if for your

described but it s not perfect so here are some things to consider before buying for one thing it s hand wash only i d forgotten that so it was probably a good thing that it didn t fit in my dishwasher anyway it s easy to wash with a dish brush so that s not awful but sometimes you just want to put everything in the dishwasher and not think about it all the foods i ve tried with it so far are frozen products but i am going to try home fries to see if that really makes me happy i bought this pan i ll update with the results things i ve tried so far have turned out fine but i don t think it s enough different from the results i ve gotten with a plain cookie sheet to warrant this purchase the french fries and chicken tenders were reasonably crispy without turning a plus and didn t stick but the fish sticks weren t and did stick i left them in as long as the package specified but they were disappointing they didn t stick badly so the washing was still pretty easy but losing the crust on the fish seemed to defeat the purpose not sure why i expected the pan to be a two-part thing like a broiler pan but it s just the one pan with the holes so if there s a chance for oil or crumbs to fall though and mess up your oven i d suggest putting something on the shelf below to catch that i have a pizza stone on my lower shelf but a cookie sheet would work too the point of the holes is to let dry heat in from beneath the food i suppose and the directions say to put the pan only on the open grill shelf which i guess enhances that bottom line for me is that i ll continue to use the pan and think it does make baking certain things easier because you don t have to turn them to get crispiness and clean up is pretty easy but i wouldn t re-buy the product i gave it four stars anyway because it does do what it says but do we really need that if you do really a lot of frozen stuff like fries and tenders it may be worth it to you', 'kaiser'], 668: ['after reading the other reviews i was a little worried that i would be woken up in the middle of the night by errant beeping but so far so good it did beep when the coffee had perked and that was significantly louder than my old coffee maker even in my bedroom several rooms away from the kitchen i could hear it clearly might even be loud enough to wake me up i guess that could be a good thing i knew nothing about this coffee maker when i selected it from my vine newsletter it is larger than my cuisinart but because of the easy fill feature this is not really any issue i love that you can pull out the water tank and coffee filter from the front and that they are totally separate from the rest of the machine it really does become a space saver because you can keep it under cabinets and not have to be pulling it forward each day to make coffee as i was doing with my own machine my husband did all the programming so i cannot personally attest to its ease but perhaps that speaks for itself since he did it there is kind of a neat feature that the coffee make has blinking bars in minute increments to let you know how long the coffee has been perked after two hours it shuts off we have not set it to a higher temp but it is nice to know that in theory you can make your coffee hotter my only complaint at this point is that when you set the timer to brew coffee ahead of time the only thing that happens is a little clock icon pops up on the screen i kind of liked the feature on my cuisinart where a program light would come on and i had to both turn a dial to program and then flip a little switch i feel

entire turning part is made of a hard plastic it s still possible to flip eggs with it but they don t turn out nearly as nice as with my old turner which recently broke in addition the first couple

locked inside the containers the other pieces can float around your drawers or wherever you keep them but the blades keep them locked inside the pitcher blender units the pitchers are also plastic they don t mar or cut easily but the blades can and will scar them up so careful keeping your pitchers shiny and happy when washing we place the blade in the dishwasher first then the pitcher upside down on top of the blade relative to which blade it belongs to this keeps you from cutting yourself loading or unloading the dishes you get the idea the blades are freaking sharp and they re extremely close together so it s very easy to cut yourself it s like a saw you don t grab it on the jagged side and you don t grab scissors open and in the middle so don t just go grabbing the blades here people use the ends to handle it and keep yourself cut free enough about the sharpness of it because if you didn t notice it s freaking sharp really now moving on construction this is very well

at first several times a day in fact there is nothing like obliterated ice it tastes exactly like snow there is a drawback you cannot pour obliterated ice from the pitcher and the blades are extremely sharp and in the way carefully remove the blade and scoop out the ice if that s what you d like ice alone for this and most drinks you want to use your tall pitcher i will warn you not to crush ice then add cold liquids it needs to be one action ice liquid at the same time otherwise if you don t add enough liquid to your ninja to the crushed ice then it will freeze together and make it difficult to remove from the ninja and virtually useless to you because you ve turned your snow into a block that s surrounded some extremely sharp blades have fun thawing that mess out there is one exception

want to make sure you ve mixed the mixture thoroughly i ve used many different recipes for gluten free mixes including cakes cookies pancakes and pizza dough all turned out perfectly wonderful well aside from the fact they don t have gluten in them which i terribly miss again with baking too textures are often necessary in the baking process read the recipe carefully and make sure if it says the

i m not a clutter person do exactly as it says add frozen fruit instead of ice and it taste s fantastic for you gluten free and lactose free people we found using coconut milk so delicious or silk brands and a little coconut flour adds quite a bit of fiber and coconut sugar tastes fantastic too both of which you can find at your local health food store it is a little pricey but if you re on this gf diet you know it s expensive add cups of coconut milk about tbs of coconut sugar a cup of coconut flour for fiber and about cups to taste of frozen mixed fruit and you have a fantastic smoothie on your hands if you require a sugar free version of this try using splenda or a generic splenda i tried several versions of artificial sweetener and splenda by far was the nearest to actual sugar the others were very bitter one type gave me an immediate headache as far as artificial sweetener measurements splenda is one to one others check the label this is my latte recipe i didn t take

is obvious but i love the brown dark brown grill marks without burning here are some tips i tried rub majority of oil into both side of meat before cooking not the grill pan spray is good thick meat

using soap just can t help it and yes i get the rust few hours later but they can be wiped off and applying oil will make it look good again but one best technique shown at the end of one online steak cooking video was the best i ve tried while the pan still warm apply fat on the pan i just spray oil dump some kosher salt take a thick paper towel wet it and fold it upscrub pan with wet paper towel in the direction of the ridges and the salt will absorb the dark oil stains and become dark itself most crusty stuff will break and mixed in with salt after a scrub the dirty salt can just be dumped into trash can for real stubborn stains i tried whisk and even bbq metal brush and scraper while the grill still hot but i do find salt and paper towel scrub to work pretty darn well anyway i love my

waste your money on those cheap two piece aluminum garlic presses the better design is one like this where you have two pieces of heavy steel with a freely rotating plunger that mashes the garlic i usually have a plate of pasta with oil and garlic once a week so i use a garlic press regularly i picked up this calphalon unit on sale at a local store i already had a press but this one has a large opening for garlic it holds the largest clove of garlic i ve managed to purchase i also no longer peel the garlic with a knife instead i use this press i cut off the ends of each clove with a knife then put a single clove in the press and lightly squeeze i can then pretty easily remove the outer peel don t squeeze too hard or the garlic will start oozing all the good juice the plunger is a nice fit into the opening and almost no garlic squeezes out the top the large opening also makes it easier to scrape out all the useful garlic that is left after using the press cleaning is easy i use an old toothbrush and it works like a charm while this is a sturdy feeling metal i try to hold the press as close to the head as i can so i don t bend the handles i ve worn out presses like this but i

asked if we should get a dyson for a vacuum no way i started looking amazon sent me a notice offering thehoover multicyclonic canister sh40060for i bought it my wife was pissed because we didn t have a discussion first end of background statement i put it together without needing the instruction booklet good show hoover the entire vacuum structure is plastic so is my wife s high-precision bernina sewing machine not a confidence builder but not a problem either it makes the business end light and easy to move around i pulled out the cord and plugged it in the cord is almost the length of the cord on our royal upright bad show hoover this is a substantial but far from fatal annoyance i can vacuum my entire sq-ft ground floor with the royal plugged into one outlet i have to move the cord times to do the same floor with the hoover the first thing i noticed when i turned on the multicyclonic it is quiet compared to the royal tv and normal-voice conversations are possible with the thing running well done venturing across hardwood floors i found the machine works just wonderfully it picks up hair from our beagle with no problem and demonstrates it s prowess with a ball of fur whirling around in the transparent canister very nice here is the bad news the soft flexy hose does not have rotating couplings to keep the hose un-wound when i tried to double back to a corner i had missed the hose kinked and collapsed under high torque or bending loads and it did so at both the canister end and at the handle end the cyclone depends on high-velocity flow which ends abruptly when the hose collapses bad bad job hoover the hose is the weakest point of an otherwise very good design why cheap it out with a cent piece of hose in the quantities these things are manufactured a chunk of reinforced hose with rotating couplings would add at most to the purchase price big deal i worry about whether these kinks will set into the hose as permanent creases causing me to wonder whether the typical manufacturer s scam for a replacement part will cost me or more the hose on our royal upright has some issues but when we pull on it it never ever kinks no matter what direction we move

to hoover s web page a replacement hose can only be had as a complete hose head assembly hoover wants for it for a hose on a vacuum come on people as of this date hoover is in the process of selling

pounds so i d opt for the smaller and cheaper pound scale i love this scale haven t had any problems mentioned by two other reviewers hassle with automatic shutoff or short battery life having read the reviews using the scale i put a stainless steel bowl on the scale zero it out scoop in flour chocolate butter nuts or whatever individual ingredients i m weighing dump it into prep bowl and weigh the next item no problem with shutoff like any food prep cooking it helps to get the ingredients out and measured before you start cooking if you measure dry ingredients like flour sugar things that be swept out of the bowl dump them and move onto things like eggs butter or chocolate that will leave a residue you can keep using the same bowl so you only need to zero once and there is no shutoff i liked that the scale automatically shuts off if you remove the bowl and let the scale sit idle for minutes saves batteries and i don t have to either stop or remember to shut it off or touch the scale with less than as julia child would say impeccably clean hands not sure what the battery life is i ve heavily used the scale without replacing the battery but in reading the review regarding batteries only lasting a week i wondered whether the scale was either defective or being automatically turned on when not in use so i keep the scale in the manufacturers box so it can t be accidentally turned on in the drawer and i don t have to store it flat as recommended by oxo in terms of accuracy this little beauty is amazing i needed to weigh ounces of chopped chocolate the scale is so accurate it could register the difference to th of an ounce about a chocolate chip granted not a big deal but in baking humidity and accuracy matter so when i m measuring something like flour it makes a difference of a couple of ounces whether one uses a scoop and level or spoon and level method to gauge how much flour a recipe actually requires', 'oxo'], 731: ['very convenient in cake pans but

melitta cup filters i love my bodum french press and will continue to use it but it can be a real hassle at times especially when you re in a rush that s why i ve decided to buy the brew n go after a long debate and reading numerous reviews here on amazon i decided to go for it problems i ve read so far includes but not limited to mug overflowing2 mug gives off plastic taste3 brewing stops midway and has to be restarted4 cheaply made5 unit turns on by itselflet me address these from my perspective i cannot believe how this unit can over flow your mug i simply don t because the spout hole where the hot water comes out from although small allows the water to come out slowly but at a constant rate the mug lid is recessed deeply enough to hold enough liquid as to not spill even taking out the basket and filter and brewing just water doesn t overflow the mug with lid attached this is important because even with nothing blocking the water flow the water still doesn t come out fast enough to cause a overflow once you put your coffee grinds in the water flow should be slower still which leads me to believe how on earth can this overflow your mug being that the mug s interior is plastic you will initially get that yucky plastic smell however i simply soaked the mug with hot water and soap let it sit for a couple of hours wash it out thoroughly and the smell was all but gone my first cup of coffee using the brew n go with the included mug was awesome and didn t have that plastic taste the interior being plastic is bad i know but i knew that prior to making the purchase thanks to the other reviewers since i only got the unit i cannot say anything about the brewer stopping halfway through the process i will definitely edit this review at a later date should this happen to me as well for less than i expect this little coffee brewer to be cheaply made i don t what you folks were expecting but many generic coffee makers consist of cheap plastic why else could you buy it for such a low price if you want a better built product look elsewhere but then i m sure you ll complain about the price as long as the plastic holds and doesn t melt down i m not sure what the problem is this one is scary but it happened to me however this only happened during the first time hopefully i plugged in the brewer the light was not on but luckily i decided to test out the unit anyways by pouring water into the reservoir immediately it starting boiling the water even though i didn t switch the button after that initial brew cycle everything is back to normal to be on the safe side make sure to have water in the reservoir the first time you plug in the unit the cleanup process is super easy and i love the part that you do not need to purchase any paper filters the coffee came out great i used their suggested and tablespoons of coffee grinds and it was a good idea i m so shocked at how fast the water heated the time between switching the unit on to water coming out is literally

warm for hours sorry it doesn t at least mine don t i work hours straight no breaks add to that drive time to work and by the time i am ready to eat lunch it s hours at least it was a degree above room temperature certainly not hot not even luke warm if you plan on eating in say hours then i would try it i even tried boiling hot soup actually placing it in the container still boiling to try to see if that helped it did not help at all up date i felt it necessary that you see the original review keep in mind at the time it didn t work and i wasn t a happy camper this way you can see the entire story for yourself so i left it intact on purpose it s all true the container simply didn t work some astute employee at stanley saw my less than stellar review and said wait just one second here buster our products work and we will prove it ok she didn t say that but she wanted to i m sure she contacted me and sent me a new one yup i stand corrected it works after hours my soup was not as hot as when cooked but not cold either it was definitely an acceptable temperature and i really enjoyed my soup at am it beats a pb and j sandwich after hours more like of course it will loose some temperature remember i am asking it to do the maximum it was designed to do and then some it does it and it does it well now i am not only happy that i own one but i am also impressed to find at least one employee excelling in customer service i am going to buy another one look folks i got a defective item no big deal it happens they did the right thing replaced it as promised and now i agree it does the job you see it s main parts some how fused together leaving a vacuum between them the vacuum is what insulates the food and helps it maintain temperature some how mine lost it s vacuum so it would not maintain temperature if you get one that works you will love it if not just call them they will make you happy now i give it stars thanks to that stanley employee who contacted me i hope someone at stanley sees this and recognizes her for her outstanding customer support yup another update by accident after washing this item i discovered that i could hear water sloshing around inside the original defective container cool a great way to test your own vacuum insulated containers simply submerge them in water over night in the am if water gets in there you have lost vacuum somehow and since stanley has a lifetime warranty your covered if not you should be good to go just thought i would pass that along i hope my review has helped you to decide so i got a defect it can happen to anyone the point is they stand behind their product made it right and the new one works i ll be buying stanley one more update well the replacement item failed got no clue what the issue is but once again stanley gladly and promptly replaced it yes stanley is serious about warranty with stanley lifetime warranty means lifetime warranty i would suggest that you skip this model whatever it is that s causing the failures i do not know but i do love it when it works and will buy another however i think i will try the same item but an older model in hope they will be more reliable update again yes again i realize this is hard to believe but true after just a month the replacement for the replacement failed yes stanley to the rescue again but now i am wasting food and money not to mention without this item for another week or two even thought they replace it every time i can no longer recommend this item when it works its great the problem it it only works for a month then quits now its just a total waste of time en effort and aggravation and phone calls not worth it stanley needs to solve this problem permanently simply replacing it is fine but come one guys how many times are we going to go threw this before we admit we got a serious issue in manufacturing here this is what happens when you have your items made in china when will you learn quality matters and your harming your good name and reputation fix this issue or refund my money or let me try another model that actually does work i can imagine this is insanity some products stanley makes are reliable this one is useless and they seem to be ignoring the issue update i think i finally have gotten to the bottom of this you must fill it up with food if you want it to stay warm for hrs now if stanley just would tell us this none of this would have happened yes caps were on purpose it seems that less than full of food it don t work well full of hot food and it stays hot even if you don t want to eat that much food sorry people you got to fill it up i m no engineer or scientist but my guess is if the container has any air space in it it wont hold temp for long i pulled my hair out but i finally figured it out one would think the genius that make this would know this and would disclose it ok so fill it up folks and yup i love it again hate to waste food but that s the only way it worked no air space is the trick now someone please explain why to me i m sure its a simple mr wizard answer and i m just missing it update ugggggg number just died now i m informed that they no longer make this model ship them all back to them for investigation and they will ship me a substitute this is better than a soap opera i ll let you know what happens next stay tuned final update why because i give up its just not worth it they sent me i ll call them and right out of the box number was defective meaning it had zero vacuum so it dint maintain hot nor cold is still working the frustration level is no longer worth it i m done buying any stanley products simply replacing defective units with more defective units is not a solution to the problem since stanley seems to have zero interest in fixing their

safely the down side is that it is relatively small so if you re going to be doing a lot of grating the container will have to be emptied often but being small isn t all bad as it makes it easier to store in the kitchen drawers', 's4'], 743: ['when i unpacked this set of cookware i was skeptical they all seemed to be slightly too small to actually cook for a family after i used the piece for a few days i was pleased to discover that i was wrong the middle sized skillet was quite large enough to handle a full pound of hamburger to simmer into spaghetti sauce the stockpot more than large enough to handle a pound of spaghetti and the largest skillet accommodated a half pound of bacon i was further pleasantly surprised at just how nonstick the nonstick surfaces are i managed to flip a fried egg with just a flick of the wrist no spatula required and then easily slide it onto my plate this set is also a joy to work with the pans are heavy enough to feel substantial but not so heavy as to be difficult to manage even when filled the glass lids fit snugly and allow the food to be monitored without lifting the lids allowing heat to escape the handles are comfortable to hold and well insulated enough that a oven mitt is not needed the set includes a nice assortment of cookware which covers most of the needs of an average sized family from preparing a single egg or a can of soup to

that is supposed to go down to release came off so if one is going to release they must do so carefully or they will end up fishing it out of the garbage the saving grace is that the suction is still very good and able to handle the dog hair however i use this as it was a vine product i would not recommend it original review i have three large dogs and was concerned i would be emptying the canister every two minutes it does hold a surprising amount based on its appearance and i do get quite an amount of dog hair up before having to empty it just slightly less than my dyson animal vacuum there is some assembly required but it was very simple and i had the vacuum ready to go in less than five minutes including unpacking the handle on the canister is a bit high for me but i am on the short side this would be good for a person with a bad back as it does not require a lot of bending to us it there were two downsides for me one was the weight which is more than any other vacuum i have had including a miele and another bagged wind tunnel it is not a problem for me but if someone cannot life a heavier vacuum cleaner this would not be a good choice for them also with the weight and design it is a bit cumbersome bringing it up and down the stairs if one lives in a two floor house a few further thoughts after using it for a few weeks as noted it is a bit on the heavy side and can be somewhat awkward to manuever more importantly the head is very difficult to remove so that one may use the wand and attachments there is a piece that one is supposed to push on to get it out

lacked depth when used in the inverted position for a tart the well will provide space for both custard and fruit toppings it s more suited to that use than for a flan the second drawback is a major one for english language-only consumers both the product s box and its accompanying recipe instruction booklet are written in german from the pictures in the booklet it appears that it features a

tell you that this very low priced dirt devil cyclonic upright is every bit the vacuum my dyson is and more one of the biggest complaints i have had with the dyson is the way their attachments connect to the machine it is always a huge fight getting them on and then off and more than one attachment has broken in the process even though i was always very careful with them i am happy to report the included attachments that come with this dirt devil are built as well or better than my dyson attachments and they go on and off easily it makes this vacuum a real joy to use the extender wand attachment the extra hose the furniture attachment the crevice tool they are all totally functional and really easy to put on and take off the vacuum the hose is plenty long enough too and the power cord is long enough to keep replugging down to a minimum it really is amazing how much you get for your money with this thing the filters need to be cleaned replaced occasionally and that can be a real pain but i have had to do that for the last years with my dyson and i am used to it now as for the effectiveness of the electrostatic turbo tool i can t really speak to that as we don t have any pets however i did use it on a large couch that had not been vacuumed or cleaned in the last years after the dyson attachments gave up on me and it got the couch very clean to see for myself how much dirt and hair the tool removed i first started with an empty dirt cup so i could actually see what was picked up i am embarrassed to tell you just how much but believe me when i say it was sizable yikes so how does the dirt devil measure up to my much more expensive dyson in the actual vacuuming department in a word better i am trying hard to avoid the old clich eacute in describing this dirt devil but i just can t resist it really sucks but in a good way honestly after using the dyson for more than years and then trying the dirt devil in the same areas of carpet and tile flooring i was very pleased to find just how much more dirt and crud i was picking up with the dirt devil i did not expect this level of performance from something this inexpensive i guess i was just suffering from some vacuum cleaner prejudice i want to reiterate that the overall build quality of this vacuum is very good i was not expecting so much for so little i wish i could have purchased one of these dirt devils years ago instead of wasting so much money on my now much maligned dyson bottom line the dyson is being stored in the garage just in case and the dirt devil is now occupying the place of honor

['first a word about aeration aeration is the process of introducing red wines to oxygen it s most effective on young red wines because the aging itself is a very slow aeration process on the right wine aeration makes the flavor richer and more complex up to now i thought the only choices to aerate were let the wine sit in adecanterfor an hour let the wine sit in a glass for an uncomfortably long thirsty time or let the wine age on a shelf for several years what i liked about the vinturi red wine aerator it works this aerator is a great fourth option to the three above especially if you like to drink one or two glasses from a bottle instead of decanting a whole bottle or waiting you can pour one or two glasses through this funnel you will get better flavor out of immature wines which is really most of what we drink in my house if you only drink one or two glasses at a time also consider getting something like thevacu vinso that your wine doesn t over aerate into vinegar while sitting in your refrigerator or on your shelf the vinturi is really beautiful instead of sticking it in the back of a drawer with the corkscrews and wine stoppers we have this displayed on the bar it s corny but imho drinking wine is kind of a ritual activity and pulling out this crystal gadget adds to the whole wine experience it s dishwasher safe and it comes with a strainer attachment that you can use to strain sediment or bits of cork i m just really impressed by the overall thoughtful design what could be better it tends to leak a few drops of wine after we re done pouring i don t have a good solution other than to set it on a paper towel or set it in the stand and let the stand catch the drops overall i couldn t be happier highly recommended to drinkers of youngish red wines note

concern i have with this tool is that there are two ways to position the food pusher but only one way you want to position it i shaved off a few slivers of plastic before my husband noticed that i had the pusher turned so that it could contact the blade but now that i know about that possibility it probably won t happen again i would recommend this mandoline to anyone wanting a good tool for their

only get about two years of use out of them before their pumps fail i replaced my b70 with a breville and it just recently passed away before i let myself calculate just how much money that i have spent on an easy way to make a cup of coffee i purchased this unit overall i am very pleased with it it doesn t have all of the bells and whistles of my other k-cup coffee makers but it s got enough of the features that i need however i do miss the clock one thing that is really nice is that it has a drain feature something missing from my other keurigs this allows one to drain the unit of the water that is deep inside the machine preparing it for transport or storage the one real feature that caused me to buy this model over the others will take a while to prove itself and that is

be a perfect juicer for everyone but this is the best i ve owned thus my rating i ve been on a quest for the past year buying and then giving away various juicers and juicing attachments i was about to give up and resign myself to keep purchasing some very good organic orange juice at our local store but at for a half-gallon well egads so then i spotted this beauty wow it shines it has substance it can be lifted up away from the corded base and even stored in the fridge if you care to and it s very simple to use and easy to clean what more could you want the description about the appliance is accurate it has a base with cord that can stay put you do your juicing and you can then use the container to serve and pour or put the little hard plastic cover on top to then store it in your refrigerator to start juicing you just press it starts with that action and will stop when you lift the citrus off the rotating cone i ve only done oranges but limes would be fine too i don t know about grapefruit unless they re somewhat small there is only one juicing cone one size is supposed to fit all sometimes the cone does reverse sometimes it doesn t i couldn t figure out what made it reverse but in the long run that really made no difference in juicing unlike some other juicers i ve tried when the basket becomes too full of pulp this one lifts out easily to be rinsed out and put back in use for continued juicing the juice cone even has these little paddles that kind of stir the pulp around the basket while it s juicing rotating to make sure as much juice as possible drips into the container now that s clever and practical i bought several cases of valencia oranges and the container can hold about half of one case worth of orange juice if you want to do more than that pour it into a beverage container or pitcher and keep going i did although juice is best when it s served that day just a little hint although your fresh juice will be so delicious i bet it won t last much longer than a day cleanup is a snap everything comes apart and fits back in quickly and easily washes by hand quite nicely but the instruction book implies you shouldn t put any of the parts in the dishwasher you definitely wouldn t want to put the chrome stainless wood container in there because the underside shouldn t be immersed and the harsh dishwasher soap would ruin the wood look the one thing i didn t find terribly helpful was the area underneath the base to wind the cord before i put it all away it was a bit of a struggle to wind it tightly the end of the cord stuck out anyway and then i had to undo all that the next time i used the juicer so that winding rewinding really was unnecessary if you have more of these krups chrome stainless wood appliances that you leave on your counter hiding the cord would be a non-issue anyway no points deducted for that beautiful design and materials top quality easy to use and clean really it is the best juicer out of a field of mediocre

is nothing like drinking from a ceramic cup it enhances the flavor more than you can imagine you cannot mess up making the espresso the capsule is hermetically sealed in aluminum there is absolutely no air exchange unlike plastic or paper containers there is no need to refrigerate or freeze these capsules they do not deteriorate due to air exchange nespresso has solved some of the most critical variables in making espresso fineness of coffee grind roast time and temperature preventing air from interacting with the coffee pressure and temperature of the water and brew residence time each cup tastes exactly the same one after the other the espresso itself oh my goodness i have spent a lot of time in italy drinking espresso at corner cafes nespresso is as good as if not better than anything i ever had in italy it is the rare us or canadian restaurant that can brew a better espresso nespresso has become the gold standard by which i judge espresso when i travel the crema on these drinks is amazing thick rich and perfect this machine is a replacement for a six year old nespresso model d290 this lovely machine made maybe espressos it was incredibly reliable up until a few weeks ago it started to act strange not wanting to heat when first turned on the only maintenance was descaling the machine every months i expect the citiz to last just as long admittedly i am addicted to this machine the espresso two to three espressos per day is my standard and my wife usually has one or two lungos per day hopefully you can understand that i love this machine and i love this espresso this is far superior to any other on demand coffee makers this machine makes real espresso noise yes this machine makes noise the citiz is slightly quieter than the older models but it still makes noise all mechanical espresso machines make noise there is no way around that problem you have to pump the water to reach the some odd psi to make real espresso to me this machine makes the most beautiful noise ever it s a solid heavy pump sound not some wimpy whiny noise it s also so beautiful because my mind knows what is coming next a great cup of espresso the real competitor to this machine the illy line and true ground espresso machines here s the huge downside to those machines the illy machines are well over and the cartridges are paper wrapped so once you open the can you need to use all those cartridges quickly air is ground coffee s worst enemy the ground coffee versions you have a long warm up time to build heat and pressure in the vessel you have to grind your own coffee there s a huge variable introduced in grind size and coffee packing and you have messy coffee grounds to clean up when you compare this machine to the alternatives for real espresso this is a cheap machine add the convenience and this is a no brainer choice to me the one downside to this machine and all the nespresso machines you have to buy your coffee from nestle directly over the internet or phone nobody else makes these capsules myself i simply buy at a time and watch my supply from ordering to delivery is usually days one of my biggest concerns in buying this was the longevity of nestle producing these capsules i think they will produce these for a long time in the future the machine dates back to it is very popular in europe the capsule they use is a commodity aluminum capsule that is used by a number of other industries in other words nestle buys these formed aluminum capsules fills them and seals them there is no proprietary container unlike the other two popular beverages on demand machines nestl eacute s investment in capsule manufacture and distribution all internet or phone based with no marketing in the us is really small for a great return to them visiting italians have told me this is the best espresso they have ever had in the us and my wife who rarely ever drank brewed coffee looks forward to her lungo every morning if you are looking for that special arena and only want an on-demand beverage maker this is by far the best machine you can buy bosch tas4511uc tassimo single-serve coffee brewer silk silver just remember it makes great coffee cappuccino hot chocolate tea but it does not make espresso no matter what anyone says or claims it is incapable of doing that they have fixed the awful sound of the original machine by working with bosch the other alternative for just coffee making no cappuccino or hot chocolate keurig b60 special edition gourmet single-cup home-brewing system the perfect accessory for the citiz is the aeroccino this is well worth the approximately investment it makes perfect foamed milk with no skills required nespresso aeroccino plus i chose the citiz without the foamer included in the kit because i like the tiny footprint of this machine the additional space for the foamer on the base takes up a lot of counter space i really like the simplicity of this model the pixie is a newer model from nespresso i m not as impressed with that machine in real life it doesn t look as cool as this machine june update i ve actually used a pixie there is a big difference in machines the pixie makes a lot more noise and maybe not a good different noise the citiz is much quieter the other option is the essenza pretty much the same internal parts as the citiz it is just squat and doesn t come in fun colors adjusting the cup height is a little more complicated with the essenza these machines have gotten less and less expensive over the years my c290 list price was almost years ago these new machines in the price

['i am not an ironing aficionado but i have had some ironing experience in the past and still need to occasionally take the iron down and de-wrinkle something i received the t-fal utraglide easycord a little over a week ago and honestly i have been looking for things to iron and steam i had a commercial grade rowenta iron that was large heavy and took forever to heat up this t-fal is the antithesis of that one it is lightweight about lb but solid it has a smaller more concise design that features a very ergo-dynamic handle that fits the right or left hand easily i will get into the features in depth in a minute but i have to talk about the ingenious cord first one of my problems with ironing has been that i am what my mom calls a backwards ironer apparently i don t stand on the correct side of the board nor do i place things to iron on the front side of the board i tend to favor the middle for everything except for sleeves etc these ironing practices have had me struggling with the cord constantly catching on the area of clothing i just ironed or causing me to reposition myself so i didn t get myself caught in the cord the cord on this t-fal is not only a swivel cord this cord all but disappears while using the iron to the point where i seriously don t even notice it and it is long too feet long i used to have to get an extension cord out for my old rowenta the body construction of this iron like i mentioned earlier is very streamlined yes it has a plastic upper but that is part of why it is so lightweight here are some of the features on this model steam holes microholes for ultimate steam diffusion across entire fabric with a concentration at at tip large steam holes for advanced steam performance-extended heel designed to hold the cord securely in place when in storage-cord exit at back of handle to reduce contact with cord when ironingway auto-off with blinking warning light for maximum safety-self cleaning system includes anti-scale valve for extended life-continuous steam output up to g min powerful burst of steam up to g min provides additional steam for stubborn wrinkles-large oz water tank for fewer refills spring assisted water tank cover with large sealed inlet opening for ease of filling and prevention of water spillage comfort handle makes ironing less cumbersome foot white cord large ergonomic spray and burst of steam buttons for ease of use temperature indicator light goes off when selected temperature is reached round thermostat dial with precision control this iron heated up within seconds i don t know if that is the norm but the rowenta took at least minutes and longer if it had water to produce steam the steam button worked great without that weird air filled burst of steam you get with some irons this one produced a nice steady steam you can also vertically steam something with this iron which is great for my draperies and other things i want to steam clean again the lightweightness of this iron comes in handy here the water compartment is located in a great spot towards the top of the handle the chamber has a spring type lid which ensures you aren t going to be leaking any water out of that opening while the iron is horizontal the water also empties out completely with little effort when you are finished i have had some irons where you have to shake the heck out of it to empty the water chamber the booklet that came with the iron shows one can fill the chamber directly from a faucet but i have never done that with an iron and don t recommend it easier to use a measuring cup of some sort the ironing surface has a nice smooth finish although i am not sure why there are grid lines on it maybe just for visual effect the temperature dial features a silk synthetic setting that is nice to have but just remember not to have water in the iron when you use that setting as it will be too hot with any residual steam still trying to come out the two things i would like to see t-fal change on this model is the positioning of the setting dial it is a bit awkward located underneath the handle also the water shot feature next to the steam button is odd if the iron is horizontal as it usually will be and you shoot a spurt of water onto your garment the water is going to go straight out and not down directly onto the garment so you would have to pick the iron up and physically direct the entire iron to the spot you want to water they could fix this by making the nozzle a directional nozzle instead overall i like this iron and see myself ironing more now that i don t have to

trapped between the black plastic inner band and the glass portion of the carafe to me this indicates the adhesive used to join the two pieces may be loosening which allows the particles to become trapped not only is it unappetizing and unappealing in appearance it also causes some concern as to whether the plastic and glass pieces of the carafe might separate when coffee is being poured and cause an injury when placing the carafe on a hard surface be sure you are placing it so the flat bottom as a whole comes in contact with the surface i have broken the two previous carafes because when

been using this product for about six weeks and i love it i would have given it stars but the assembly instructions are poorly written causing a number of reviewers myself included to encounter operating problems fortunately once you know the procedure it is so simple set bowl on base leave lid off for now with its handle pointed in the direction of the power buttons and handle slightly turned to the right of center no more than half an inch once the bowl is in this position and firmly on the base slide the bowl left toward the center of the two power buttons you will notice a lip on the front of the base just above the center between the buttons on which the handle rests when engaged this lip has a dot on it into which the spring lock in the bowl handle fits slide the bowl handle toward the lip until it engages place the chopper blade over the center post spindle not to be confused with the spindle attachment which accommodates the round shredder slicer blade in the center of the bowl now put on the lid the same way you positioned the bowl the food chute on the lid goes toward the back of the base and away from the handle on the bowl place it on the bowl a half inch or less off center to the right front note that there is a small locking cylinder on the underside of the lid just behind the chute the metal pin in the top of the chopper blade fits into the lock on the lid make sure the chopper pin is inside the lid lock then slide the lid toward the handle until it slips into place you can see the spring lock depress through the clear handle of the bowl as the lid engages now the lid and bowl are locked onto the base when you are finished processing remove the lid first and then the bowl by reversing the instructions slide less than a half inch to the left and lift this might sound complicated but it truly isn t you just have to get the hang of it remember you must lock the bowl to the base first then the lid and then remove in the reverse order due to the locking system design this processor is well worth the price and has performed beautifully for me but there is something about the setup of this appliance that initially struck me as counter-intuitive maybe its because the bowl handle and the lid chute are opposite one another whatever the problem once you know how to assemble the parts it is a beautifully functioning machine please remember that you cannot remove the bowl from the base until you disengage the lid lock you can use the slicing shredding disc without the chopping blade by slipping the spindle adapter over the center post in the bowl as mentioned by another reviewer there is a small space between the bottom of the chute and the inside edge of the lid where food can collect just be sure you rinse it right after using when any remaining food can be easily dislodged with a stream of water a stiff brush or butter knife depending upon the density of the food this entire appliance cleans up quickly and easily with a little soap and water and keep in mind that this is not a blender so i would not recommend trying to process liquids i foolishly tried to process ingredients for a quiche and it leaked rather badly however i have made salsa many times with no leakage so liquids combined with bulk haven t been a problem just don t let them sit too long or you will probably have leakage as for noise i expect any kitchen appliance with a motor to produce some sounds so it really hasn t bothered me it is no more offensive than the blender dishwasher vacuum cleaner and sometimes the washer when it is off balance but i will tell you that i have yet to use anything other than pulse mode this processor is crazy powerful so unless you are pureeing baby food or making a thick sauce i suggest you use the pulse button at least until you can judge the power of the machine for your particular purpose the suction cup feet on the base are unusually muscular don t think you can slide this baby around your counter because you have to break a strong suction to move it i think this is a wonderful safety feature for those with toddlers because there is no way they have the strength to pull it off a counter onto their heads and the locking system which secures together the base bowl and lid ensures that the bowl won t be dislodged from the base by tiny fingers pulling on the handle i am always searching for quality products at a great value and this b d processor is one of my favorites i hope my assembly instructions help but if you guys find them confusing just let me know and i will delete this post or maybe someone can improve my directions i would have submitted a video review of assembly which takes about seconds but can t find my camera a picture is worth a thousand words for those of you who are in

lightweight i ve been cooking elaborately for years and have used a wide variety of kitchen gear like most seasoned cooks i have my favorite pans and pan-types and habits in how i use them i was pleased to see several of my usual sizes included in this set including the qt saute pan the qt dutch-oven style stockpot and the skillet the qt saucepan is adequate though i usually prefer a qt the sides of the saute pan are high enough to stir a thick pasta sauce the stockpot has a wide enough base to allow meat to brown the one omission is a heavy-bottomed skillet something i use regularly for frying and searing less useful is the qt saucepan there s not much i d make in a qt that wouldn t be fine in the qt and the skillet is too small to be useful it s fine if you want to fry an egg or saute garlic or a single shallot separately but i prefer to do that in the larger pan with the rest of the ingredients the better to meld the flavors and to have fewer dishes to wash most things that you would sear toast or saute will benefit from being in contact with the pan s cooking surface making a small surface area less useful but four out of useful pans is a much better ratio than most sets caveats unlike my calphalon pans the handles on these are only rated oven-safe to f rather than a more useful f ceiling after months use on a glass-top electric range the skillet the piece i ve been using most has dark mars on the bottom bad if you hang display your pans the largest caveat is that these pans are entry-level thin they do heat up quickly but the thinness makes them bad for cooking dishes where the pan temperature needs to stay low-but-even or where you re going to be adding cold items to the hot pan eg searing these are far too thin to retain heat when you plop down a new york strip for the beginner cook who doesn t have their own preferences or existing collection this is a nice set to get them started and it look nice too a good choice for a gift this piece set is a bit expensive versus other entry-level sets and has a couple of filler pieces but is a well-rounded package recommended with caveats update nov these pans continue to hold up surprisingly well after a year of solid usage and i ve grown increasingly fond of them so increasing my rating from stars to stars the outer surfaces have gotten discolored stained from such regular usage but the interiors remain flawless and i find i reach for these pans more often than some of my heavier old-school pans', 'rachael ray porcelain'], 932: ['these are very comfortable to hold and very sturdy the

kitchenaid mixer the artisan model almost years ago it was still going strong and looking great but i needed something bigger for my home based baking business after researching a variety of products i decided to stay with kitchenaid and buy the kp26 professional series after a holiday baking season in which i produced hundreds of cookies cakes of all sizes and countless loaves of bread i m convinced that i made the right choice there s a new feature no matter what speed the mixer is set to the paddle moves very slowly at first rather than jumping right up to speed this prevents a cloud of flour or powdered sugar from popping out of the bowl and settling all over the kitchen this might not seem like a big deal but anything that reduces clean-up time is a plus the pour-shield fits snugly around the top of the bowl and stays in place it makes getting ingredients into the bowl much easier and also keeps them in the bowl and off the counter no more whipping cream or meringue splatters all around the mixer i grant that the motor is noisy but given the ease with which it handles large batches of bread dough cake batter and decorator icings i m fine with it the quart bowl is huge it is also very heavy especially when filled with dough but the handle is well designed and relatively easy on the hand i have a bit of arthritis in my hands so it s sometimes tricky for me to get heavy batters into the pans but this is a minor issue in a product whose overall quality surpasses that of anything i ve ever used my one negative experience was with a defective starter switch i had to tinker with it to get the mixer to come on but i called customer service and got friendly courteous service a new mixer was sent right away and meanwhile i devised a method for getting the mixer to operate reliably so all my baking was done as it should have been the new unit arrived sooner than i expected and worked perfectly if it hadn t been for the excellent customer service i d have deducted a star from my rating but my overall experience has been so positive that i felt that a star rating was justified if you regularly bake bread and or make lots of big batches of other baked goods this mixer is well worth the investment i expect to be mixing away for years to come oh and did i mention that the mixer is red and absolutely gorgeous', 'kitchenaid kp26m1xlc professional

also appreciate that it runs quietly since we run it through the night on low it s no louder than your average box fan and during the day the high setting is not too loud not audible outside the room really we do have to switch it off to watch movies in that room running only on low it pulls a bucketful of water every to hours and the dampness in our room has significantly decreased it does cycle

stronger than others and sometimes it has other off tastes we ve been using a brita pitcher for years and there s a pur filter built into the frig that we use but i still never thought the chlorine taste was completely gone then a couple weeks ago i saw an article in consumer reports rating water filters in the pitcher dispenser category the pitcher listed was a clear o pitcher and filters and the price for both the pitcher and filters was the most reasonable of any in that category i ordered the pitcher which came with a filter installed and could tell a big difference in the water right away it seemed completely without taste like distilled water to me that s a good non-taste i actually like drinking water again the pitcher has to be connected to the faucet to fill it with a small hose which is attached to the pitcher that folds back into the handle when not in use you have to use their faucet adapter which comes with it and fits the hose it only took a couple of minutes to install i also ended up getting one for the upstairs bathroom and using their adapters also installed in about minutes the hose has a quick release type mechanism so you just slide back a cuff and push it on or off the faucet you don t have to screw in on or off having to do that would have been a deal breaker one thing that could be better about the pitcher design is that you have to hold the pitcher upright as it begins to fill because the hose is rather stiff and the pitcher will fall over if you don t hold it up until it has enough water in it to keep it upright but it only takes about or seconds to completely fill which is way better than the old brita pitcher which took several minutes there is a gauge on top that measures by usage how much water you have filtered rather than just doing it by date like most other brands it also holds more water than the old brita liters of water oz glasses i m finding that we use about or pitchers per day because i filter water for pet water bowls and also the water we use for coffee and tea i can taste the difference in the coffee and tea it has a much better taste than before i ve also started to drink a lot of water instead of diet soda because i like the clear clean taste i bought a oz contigo autospout addison ounce water bottle blueand i fill it at least times during the day it says that a filter should supply pitchers of water before having to be replaced which would mean it should last about weeks we used the brita filters for months but we probably should have changed them more often then again we only filled the brita once or twice a day because i didn t drink much of the water during the day amazon s product page shows this filter to be nsf certified which is incorrect i checked with nsf national science foundation as well as the manufacturer and it is no longer nsf certified because they are no longer manufacturing the pitcher or filters so when these run out that s it or maybe they ll come out with another model so with the problems with the pitcher design and the certification misprint why did i give this product out of stars this is by far the cleanest tasting water i ve ever experienced and

really doesn t save time in the end chips turn out crispier and cook more evenly if you use one tray at a time since stacking doesn t really save time i cooked one tray at a time and while the first tray was cooking i sliced arranged the slices on the other trays cooking time is quite a bit longer than the advertised minutes we have a watt dacor microwave and it took minutes to cook a single tray of thinly sliced chips check your microwave power output and adjust accordingly update below a good visual sign that they re ready is when they start to curl up a little around the edges slice chips as thin as possible for crispy chips i used a mandoline s thinnest setting i scrubbed the potatoes then left the skins on thicker slices took over minutes to cook they turned out more crunchy than crispy still good but we prefer thinner and crispier be sure to let chips cool completely they don t crisp until they are completely cool sweet potato chips are our favorite as they require absolutely

you hands on this machine without paying for it here is the lowdown on what the hell this is made of the only chrome steel is on the carafe body the very top of the machine the water and basket lids on hinges and the inside portion of the body where the carafe sits you can tell because these last two spots are actually brushed steel and not chrome shiny the lid and handle are chrome finished plastic as well as the upper and lower body the wood is a matte finish decal on top of plastic looks well enough will probably wear check my uploaded photos lt lt lt lt my opinion it is well built for being mostly plastic i would rather have this type of hard chrome plastic than what all other machine are made of as far as quality is concerned bottom line this is not a metal and wood machine it is metal where it needs to be and wood nowhere pros it is really simply made all the design flaws with other krups machines are gone the basket sits on top of smooth and solid plastic holder and can be removed easily to rinse out a simple on off switch that turns itself off immediately after the water is gone simple hinges on the basket and water lids the coffee valve at the bottom of the basket is just a button on a spring that opens when the carafe is on place and close when you pull it out no lever or long over-designed apparatus photo uploaded lt lt everything fits snugly carafe keeps water hot large sight glass works well you have to pour the water in kinda slow or the sight glass won t keep up with you and you ll overfill if you are trying to only make cups the hole in the back to prevent overfilling is really visible an improvement from all previous models so i use that as a guide when making all ten cups so far it seems like there is nothing to break on this machine5 the hot water drips onto the grounds from a ring of spouts and not just one photo uploaded lt lt beautiful designa plus and a minus impressive but requires constant wiping and very careful handling it is the type of pretty that looks like crap with a simple scratch or too many fingerprints i would ve preferred a brushed finished for the same reason they don t make chrome refrigerators a excellent design for the compulsively clean as it at least is very clean looking cons lid and spout you cannot pull it apart to clean it coffee seems to get suck inside where the thumb lever is so i don t know if i ever have completely rinsed out the entire lid that lever is chrome finish and thus shows finger grease to lock and unlock requires pushing laterally against this plastic piece and i am afraid while sturdy that this may not be good for it the spout pours poorly while not as slow as others have reviewed it doesn t like to poor the bottom cups of coffee very fast and requires around a degree tilt no leakage all parts are snug2 there is nowhere where you can touch this machine without having to wipe it off later i keep a clean rag on top of my grinder solely for this machine it does not brew hot coffee of any special regard the bunn and technivorm both are designed to do that but this is not in that type of class the spout temp i measured was and your fresh cup from a warmed carafe was around not impressive but not noteworthy either way don t let people tell you this brews coffee too cool it brews perfectly hot coffee just not made poor coffee the first times due to a funny plastic aroma and taste i ran full pots of water and some water white vinegar mix to rinse it out several times and it went away took a while and definitely wasn t out of the box ready to brew good coffee brews great after that though if you have seen my review on the krups fmf514 then you can get my stance on most thermal carafe drip machines and krups in particular basically krups have been making some poorly designed coffee machine that break easily and are close but they have some fatal flaws i have had a previous krups model and enjoyed it for a decade just fine however their products have seems to becoming less and less reputable their coffee grinder is not anything special at least to me therefore i thoroughly checked out the entire market for thermal carafe drip presses years ago they were somewhat of a luxury item and i guess were better designed and constructed now they are standard in the industry everyone that makes a coffee machine has the same machine with a carafe version it seems as i read reviews about this type of product i found that more selection doesn t mean that there are better products quite the opposite it seems like since there is so much selection that it allows machines to sell well despite major flaws and poor construction plus they all seemed to be selling bells and whistles and not a proper machine i looked at the bunn phase brew and was initially really impressed but it seems they have alot of bugs to work out the reviews are all about inconsistent manufacturing and poor reliablilty i knew about the technivorm but that things huge and expensive a good french press can make excellent tasting coffee and the technivorm is way too much machine for me plus it seems like the pioneer product that will set the standard for brewing methods and temperature i guess eye of the beholder but it is really ugly if that machine made terrible coffee people would be calling it ugly more often i think i ll start drinking espresso before i spend on a drip machine plus a grinder would be a smarter investment then a drip machine because all drip machines suck they are a product of convenience and consumption and will have something wrong with them why i went with this machine simplicity and sturdy design no construction flaws nothing special about this machine works well makes a rich cup of light roasted coffee the looks of the machine seem to have forced krups to forgo some of their bad instincts and have resulted in a quality machine if you have actually made it this far then please leave a comment about your experiences with the issues i raised above all carafes need to be prewarmed it s physics a cold carafe heats itself up by sucking heat out of the coffee meaning cooler coffee that then cannot be hot for very long plus a cool carafe has cool air inside it and when hot coffee enter it it creates a vacuum as it heats up the cooler air inside and brings in more cooler air a heated carafe is more stable people that think they can use a carafe like glass just are doing it wrong i did just that with this machine and the coffee wasn t drinkable after an hour', 'krups'], 974: ['this piece set consists of three japanese design knives a pair of kitchen shears and a storage wood block it is literally the minimum that you can have in the kitchen if you cook at least once a day i think the sofuto in the name refers to the soft touch and non-slip rubber grip of the knives you can select from three colors wasabi green lotus blue and coral red although they are dishwasher-safe i always hand wash the knives they will last and look better longer this way the largest of the three is called the santoku knife because it is a japanese design that is typically shorter lighter and thinner than a traditional western knife the word santoku means tripe purpose as in cutting dicing and mincing although it is looked upon as a general purpose food preparation knife being thinner a santoku knife s steel is harder than a western knife to retain its rigidity it should retain its sharpness longer but could be prone to chipping if used to cut hard objects this knife is nicely weighted and balanced to make using it a pleasure with a blade length of just inches this santoku is suitable for cutting small to medium sized raw meats and vegetables there is kullens grind on the blade to reduce food sticking to it after cutting the utility knife is also inches in length i use it to slice and trim smaller portion of raw meats for cooked meats i like to use serrated blade better the paring knife is and inches long i use this for paring peeling and cutting small vegetables and fruits the pair of kitchen shears works fine but does not seem to have the same quality as the knives the storage wood block is made of solid wood the four black rubber feet are much thinner and less substantial than shown on the product s web page picture in fact they are not made of rubber but sponge foam which can degrade quickly in summary the three knives are very well-made and sharp i give it four stars because the quality of the shears and the little rubber feet under the storage block could be better',

to you out of box experiencethe grill was well packaged and simple to open up the manufacturer clearly took the unboxing experience into consideration and put some thought into it not on par with apple for example but certainly more thought than i m used to seeing from small appliance manufacturers the included cookbook is a welcome addition craftsmanship fit finish and materialsthe grill has a good amount of heft to it which not only reflects well on the material selections but is also highly functional the weighty lid presses food perfectly without the need for latches or other gimmicks materials such as real metal sturdy plastics and rubber that feature attractive finishes also feel pleasant to the touch projected reliabilityhaving researched this grill i am aware that many folks have experienced issues with the thermal fuse i took this into consideration when making my purchase and being somewhat mechanically electronically inclined i made the informed decision to purchase anyways knowing that i may have to perform surgery on it at some point in the future for this i removed only one star i have been well trained by my german cars and appliances that sometimes you have to make a few tradeoffs in reliability for aesthetics performance and overall experience i am not making excuses for it s faults though mine has been flawless thus far but rather pointing out that your willingness to accept some possible inconveniences in exchange for a great overall design may be greater or less than my own using the devicethe color coded lights on the device are stylish and simple to understand it heats up to temp quickly and perfectly presses and grills everything i have thrown at it so far the ridges in the grill are closer together than on other devices i have used in the past while this does make it slightly harder to clean food seems to cook more quickly more surface area and comes out more attractively pressed as your food is less likely to deform into the indentations and appear wavy the floating center hinge is ingenious and allows for cooking items of nearly infinitely variable thickness as i mentioned previously the lid upper grill is very nicely weighted and presses your foodstuffs evenly and consistently cleanupthe grill plates on this device are fixed and not removable for cleaning in the past i have used similar devices with both fixed plates and removable ones removable plates make for easier cleanup without a doubt but fixed plates seem to provide more uniform heating across the grilling surface and on this device in particular you can load it up with food more or less from edge to edge with even cooking results this is an acceptable tradeoff for me the non-stick surface wipes clean easily as you would expect and a quick sweep with a basting brush takes care of any stray crumbs in the recesses grilling fatty meatsthe fde312 excels at sandwiches vegetables and leaner cuts of meat but might not be ideal for fattier meats such as ground beef burgers the recessed area of the grill is capacious enough to keep a moderate amount of grease out of contact with the items being cooked but it lacks the grease trap that other devices offer i grilled turkey burgers which turned out perfectly done and delicious but there was enough fat that cooked away and collected that i believe fattier meats may not do as well it s for you if you want perfectly pressed evenly cooked foods you intend to primarily cook sandwiches vegetables and leaner cuts of meat you want a device that looks and feels premium and not disposable you are willing to have the device serviced at some point or conduct a minor repair yourself in the event the heat fuse fails this has not been my experience but it has been widely reported think twice if you plan on cooking primarily fatty meats such as hamburgers or fattier cuts of beef pork you have low no tolerance for things that may need repair service design aesthetics materials and

keeper can be adjusted to fit the size of the bread loaf there are small feet on the bottom of the bread keeper that keep it from sliding around on the counter the only criticisms i have about this bread keeper are minor the two sections fit together rather loosely so you have to be careful when lifting it up or moving it so the two sections don t fall apart the included plastic cutting board is pretty small and not very useful i usually take the bread out and cut it on a larger wooden cutting board the circular vent is attached very loosely consequently any movement of the bread keeper will usually cause the vent setting to change making it necessary to frequently adjust it the bread keeper would be much better if the vent fit more snugly overall i m very happy with this bread keeper and

generally easy to use it also accommodates plenty of beans enough to make a pot of coffee though that might take a few minutes i took one star away for the lack of a lid there are two problems with this during grinding a few coffee bean fragments jump out of the hopper and land on the floor and grinders with lids are bit quieter not that any manual grinder is particularly loud i took another star away because adjusting it while not hard you unscrew the crank lift the little toothed mechanism and spin it to the desired tightness or looseness and then put it back together then you put the toothed thing back on and rescrew on the crank is kind of a hassle especially since it takes some trial and error to find where you like it other grinders have an easier and more convenient mechanism a simple clicky bolt on the bottom that doesn t require disassembly i do question the use of the mixture of plastic and glass the hopper is plastic the bottom receptacle is glass i prefer not to use plastic in food prep but don t much care in a grinder since the food isn t hot no leaching should occur on the other hand glass is heavy and plastic is light weight why not make it all plastic or all

clean surge the two main differences are that it does not have either the hand tools or the clean surge feature it s not just that it doesn t come with the hand tools it lacks the internal plumbing for the tools and therefore cannot ever use them if you don t want hand tools then this is a nice addition to the spinscrub line up the lack of clean surge isn t very important imo because that feature can be replicated by simply making another pass or two over an area while dispensing cleanser this is because the detergent is already mixed in with the cleaning water i ve owned and used a hoover steamvac for six years and i recently was given the opportunity to try out thehoover steamvac pet complete both are great units and are basically the same so i was happy to have a chance to review this product please note that my original steamvac still works great after six years if you read my review for the pet complete you ll see that the clumsiness of attaching the hose prior to using the hand tools was one thing that i m not fond of so being able to try out this new version without hand tools was a great opportunity for me prior to my first steamvac i used a bissell for about five years they both have their pros and cons but i like the hoover best overall the hoover seems like a sturdier unit to me i replaced the bissell after it stopped pumping liquid and the plastic seemed lighter and less sturdy on it the bissell was sleeker looking as this hoover is kind of commercial looking i have stain resistant carpets so my experience could be different from others i have cleaned up stains just with a cloth before using hoover cleaning solution and water that said this cleaner has worked excellently on pet stains that occur from time to time perhaps i benefit most from the ease of use it s fairly lightweight easy to fill with water and easy to operate something unexpectedly nice about this model is that the lack of hand tools and hence the holders for the hose that are on the handles of the other models allows the handle to lay flat on the ground when you lower it to remove the dirty water tank the other two models that i have wobble a bit because the hoses are on the carpet it s a small thing but i like it a lot things that i like separate tanks for the clean and dirty water also no internal water bladder like on my older bissell the tanks are all hard plastic and easy to fill empty very easy to use lightweight and easy to push around fairly quiet my dog niki really dislikes my vacuum cleaner but she doesn t mind this machine too much dries the carpet pretty well when you go over the carpet without dispensing liquid handle lies flat on the ground unlike the models with the hand tools when lowered to remove the dirty water tank things that i d change but that aren t worth removing a star being able to remove the dirty water tank without lowering the handle all the way to the floor the clean water tank pops right out of the handle and i wish that the dirty water tank was similarly easy to remove i wish that it heated the water perhaps it doesn t make a huge difference but it s something that i d like to have overall i m happy with

fill them up all the way and i didn t have any issues with spill-over i also think people may make the mistake of not soaking the popsicles themselves in warm water it really doesn t melt them it just makes them release easier they pop right out with a couple of firm pulls in regards to the sticks themselves i just read everyone s reviews on here a few other ice pop molds waited about hours before inserting the sticks that prevented them from sinking or going wonky directions they were straight no pre-soaking so easy peasy these are oz serving regular sized are smaller than thetovolo groovy ice

of then i d recommend the tovolo ones they are a very pretty mold if you don t want to use the plastic sticks that come with that model just buy popsicle sticks wrap the molds with aluminum foil poke the sticks in about hours after they re in the freezer i say hours because they re a bit larger than these progressive freezer pop molds i made some orange creamsicles with these progressive molds

looking online for the exact same model what they no longer sell that model normally i love change but when you find something perfect then change is hard i noticed some of the reviews from people who had the prior models not happy with the newer model come on people i m already traumatized by having to change from perfect you re ruining it for me after days looking through many models and many reviews i gave in to get the hs1000 figuring this was the closest model to what i had and of all the different brands most offered a food steamer or a rice cooker but not a combination all in one

already noticing differences that i ll need to adapt to the old model had different levels of water you used for each item you re making this one tells you to fill it all the way with water in the older model if you put too much water in it would take longer to cook i ve noticed cook times in this one are almost double not sure if it s a model difference or water level difference definitely

to use no cooking time recommendations are they assuming you ve owned one of these before and you already are an expert i went online and found a better manual here s the link to the manual with cooking time recommendations i m glad i found this as i mentioned before the cooking times have changed on this one and eggs are now an option on another note as i was looking through the manual it

ceramic lid the fermentation process which has no external heat provided produces enough gas to lift that lid sometimes rapidly with enough pressure you can lift anything okay the other one that let me know it was an outlier was the complaint about the canning basket no it is not built like a sherman tank but its only purpose is to lift jars unless your canning something that s way off the periodic chart of the elements we re talking seriously heavy metal here then this basket should suffice for jars containing your average garden variety of produce or fruits maybe this individual felt it should be able to carry a stack of oz bars of gold or something not sure but from my perspective the basket provided will serve its intended purpose for many years to come but maybe i m just a

were passed down through the family well seasoned cast iron is a non-stick surface the only real bad thing about cast iron is that it smokes a lot i bought this pan because it was advertised as pre-seasoned and it truly is just heat the pan up before putting any oil or food in it and it s virtually a non-stick cooking surface cleaning is easy as described using warm water no soap and a vegetable brush scrubber if needed like any other cooking utensil the secret is to use medium heat and let the pan heat up thoroughly before putting any food in butter is a good heat barometer when

previous review below a few weeks ago the second unit that was working fine also did the same go amn thing ruining my floor a second time according to what they said they appear to be going to cover the damages but i don t know how much yet however they have refused to reply to my emails after sending so far four times at the time of this writing they only replied to the first email i sent describing what happened then replied back asking for the serial and all the details i sent that and they never replied back i ll sue them at their expense if they do not reimburse me for the damages and fix this pos they are obviously defective with some kind of manufacturer defect either with the main unit itself or some out-sourced component i d much rather a repaired unit with the defect addressed rather than a replacement which is going to have the same defect stay the hell away from these it s not worth the damages now does anyone know of a dehumidifier that does not leak i would really appreciate it these danby s do and the previous whirlpool i used also leaked meanwhile i m stuck with seventy percent humidity in my home and my home will probably be flooded from isaac in a matter of hours without any dehumidifier to dry things out all because these jerks apparently so far will not honor the warranty and ignore warranty claims and of course build a defective product in the first place previousi would have to give the first unit zero stars the second one stars the first one i received had a serious problem the bucket never got any water in it the water would have just went straight out the rear but because of the plug in place it just built up and went all over the floor i removed the rear plug and water shot out of it amazon arranged to have it picked it up at no cost to me and sent me another the new one is working fine so far this thing is a monster at least on high i don t see how anyone could say it s quiet but the noise is not any issue because people are rarely in the room with it humidity is a very serious problem here because even with this large danby and five of those damprid units around the house along with an eva-dry in a bedroom and also with the central ac running hrs a day in the summer rh is never below i have to empty this thing twice about every hr period so it s definitely sucking water out of the air there is a bad design flaw with the bucket the previous whirlpool unit i had could easily be emptied with one hand it had a place in front of the bucket where you could grab it and pull it out but after taking it apart four times still cannot find any reason whatsoever as to why it suddenly started to leak all over the floor with the bucket staying dry so i had to get another one this danby you need three hands to empty the bucket in this danby because the morons that designed it and let it go to market didn t put any kind of a grab-handle on it you need one person to hold the entire unit still while two other hands grab the bucket and slide it out one hand on each side the handle get this is on the inside and it s only to carry it to empty it so when i empty it i have to hold the unit still with my head then partially pull out the bucket with both hands then grab the handle why partially out because the bottom of it also get this is angled you can t even set it down on the floor because it will tilt over very idiotic design another thing unlike the whirlpool is when you remove this bucket it keeps running for several seconds dripping water so if you want to empty it like before you go to bed you have to first shut it off then wait about a minute for the water to stop dripping then you can remove and empty it putting the bucket back in also isn t easy it takes a lot of lining up twisting and

found a better kitchen timer anywhere else however for many of those years the warranty was as i recall only two years and now even though this timer is warrantied for years the quality of the

fine but these timers do not usually last for five years and now you can t just call and get a replacement you have to find a box for the bad timer wrap it up then take it to your nearest post office and pay shipping to send it back to cdn so they can inspect it and decide whether to fix it or replace it one of the two timers i bought on amazon last year has already failed and the battery is corroded a problem i have never had before with this timer i replaced the bad battery and the unit still doesn t work so it didn t even last two years plus i am not about to bother shipping it back so cdn can inspect it not for in cost for a new timer this product deserves three stars but it would deserve or stars if the warranty was better i think the company hopes you won t bother to package a broken unit and transport it to your post office pay the return shipping etc and by the way there are some other imperfections in this timer s design the slide switch is flimsy and doesn t lock positively in position at times and the timer s magnet makes it impossible to program the timer s channels without picking the unit up the magnet clip assembly on the back makes the unit unstable if you try to program it while it s sitting on the counter in other words you cannot effectively program this timer with one hand because the timer itself is unstable when it is sitting on a counter or table however there isn t another four channel station kitchen timer available anywhere else at least not at a decent price and most cooks sometimes need four whole timer channels working at once what also happens is that quite often i have needed two or three channels operating for the kitchen and another timer to tell me when a tv program or other event is about to begin or when i have to turn

discarding the times recommended in the manual going to pots before making tea with it using only our filtered water in it unfortunately the tea we brewed had an off taste so i boiled water in our old

devil bd10125 come up in vine on paper the dirt devil and the dustbuster are nearly identical having similar power ratings and features like washable filters and an easy-to-empty dust bin in practice the dirt devil is a distant second to the dustbuster though they have identical power ratings the dirt devil simply dosen t have the same suction power whether that s because of motor inefficiency or poor nozzle design i m not sure but the dustbuster is clearly superior at picking up debris additionally the shape of the dirt devil and in particular the awkward extending nozzle hinder getting it into tight places the dustbuster s extendable nozzle is straight and rotatable so you can get it into small spaces much more easily another minor but annoying design difference is motor placement relative to the handle the dirt devil s exhaust blows directly on your hand whereas the dustbuster s design places the handle above and in front of the exhaust so you don t get an irritating warm breeze blowing on you this isn t a horrible fault but an example of poor product design faced with the same challenge the dustbuster s designers came up with a much more elegant solution i still use the dirt devil it does perform the basic tasks of a hand-held adequately if not spectacularly its dust bin is easy to empty and it is convenient to have a second vacuum for kitchen use but considering

and my husband is always coming in and out with hay on his clothing we have five indoor cats and one indoor dog so any vacuum we have has to be tough currently the vacuums i own are an oreck xl hotel upright u3800 an oreck xl little hero vacuum and a dirt devil m085590red featherlite bagged upright vacuum cleaner which died after months of use i will be comparing various aspects of these vacuums to this vacuum in my review after receiving this vacuum upon opening the box i was surprised at how many various pieces that we had to put together there were at least plastic pieces to snap together and phillips head screws to put in when i received my oreck hotel upright i only had to put in screws on a small handle which was made of metal so i wouldn t recommend this vacuum if you don t want to do assembly upon receiving overall the assembly wasn t too difficult though i did have problems snapping the turbo tool s holder onto the handle the plastic is very rigid and by the time i did get it to snap into place the plastic had a few stress marks the best feature of this vacuum for my uses is the turbo tool attachment which pushes onto the vacuum s hose and it s basically a mini vacuum with a small spinning brush to use on upholstery this attachment could be a separate machine in itself i will be using this attachment constantly the turbo tool attachment had great suction and the design took pet hair off my couches better than my oreck little hero s pet hair attachment did the separate crevice tool on this vacuum also had good suction and was a vast improvement from the dirt devil featherlight s attachments which didn t have very good suction the crevice tool suction was nearly equal to that of my oreck little hero vacuum though the oreck little hero wins out on ease of movement and hose length due to this vacuum being so lightweight it falls over all the time when you are using the attachments it is also awkward and cumbersome to have to constantly move the vacuum because the hose is so short on regular usage this vacuum is very loud in this i prefer my oreck xl hotel upright which is more powerful and not at all hard on the ears the motor of this vigor seems to be more powerful and peppy than the dirt devil featherlite was this vacuum is also very light just like the dirt devil featherlight which to me makes it seem a bit cheaply made my oreck hotel upright is light too at lbs but it s not all plastic which makes it seem much sturdier the dirt cup of this is vacuum is easy to snap in and out but inconvenient to clean and dry also you will have to let the washable filter dry for hours personally i prefer a bagged machine my oreck hotel upright i just snap a bag in and out what has improved from the dirt devil featherlite vacuum cleaner is the motor the hose to base attachment the power of the attachments cord length and the base isn t as high so you can get under some furniture you couldn t with the dirt devil featherlight my dirt devil featherlight died after only months of rather light use so i am hoping that the longevity of this vigor is better this one has a one year limited warranty my oreck xl hotel upright u3800 has a year warranty and also came with extra bags and a extra belt overall i still prefer my oreck hotel upright to this vigor though for the cheap price i think this is a good option if you want an inexpensive vacuum with attachments i definitely think the attachments on this vacuum especially the turbo tool are very nice if you own pets who sleep on your upholstered furniture i can only hope though that this one is more durable than the dirt devil featherlight if you want an inexpensive vacuum and you are debating between this dirt devil vigor and the dirt devil m085590red featherlite bagged upright

i made my first for real cup it wasn t bad at all since i ve never made espresso i really didn t know what to expect i found that illy s coffee oz at world market never heard of it but as soon as i saw the creame sp come through it was double the amount of the regular coffee from the grocery store i knew instantly i was on to something big i ve been at this days now and this morning i made the perfect cappuccino on my st try it s even better that at the local coffee shops theirs is more bitter only one shop around here rivals the taste and it s in portland at the flying elephant i bought a tamper and two oz shot glasses one thing i was having a hard time with was figuring out how much espresso was supposed to come out i read on a blog a double shot is oz espresso a single shot is oz espresso hence oz shot glass it is also supposed to only take around seconds for that oz to come out so set a timer if you like i use one shot glass to measure the milk and one shot glass to measure the espresso i think i liked the texture of the whole milk better it s creamier but have to watch my calories the skim milk definitely produces a lighter airier froth there are several ways you can screw up the espresso so pay attention to the reviewers on here as i did as far as the machine goes i ve only had it a few days and cannot comment on it compared to others as i ve never owned one i m a complete novice and will have this mastered in a few more days in the meantime i can t believe how good the cappuccino is the goal is to get the used grounds to drop out of the porta-filter the thing with the handle you put your grounds in in one piece you can pick up with your fingers and it doesn t fall apart it should be rather dry looking and feeling and resemble a hokey puck if you can pick it up in one piece and it doesn t fall apart that s exactly what you want this espresso machine and illy s coffee is so amazing you can use way too much sugar if you are not careful i only need about tbsp and it s not the least bit acid or bitter there is a dark rich flavor that stays on my palette for a long time after the cappuccino is gone i guess that s the oils from the super fresh coffee in the local coffee shops i have to use a lot more sugar to get their cappuccinos to taste good if you are new to this i don t recommend grinding your own coffee at first because there is a whole learning curve to that too so i used the cheap stuff to practice with the first several times apparently the grinders at the grocery stores are good but i ve also heard complaints about those too that s why i bought the high end expensive coffee so i could feel the grounds with my fingers to see how fine they are supposed to be the best i can figure is the grounds feel like sand from a beach i also have the wrong kind of coffee grinder where it heats up the grounds and you have fine grounds on the bottom and coarser on top not a good combination for espresso period so i won t be using that anymore in case anyone is wondering i use decaf illy espresso blend my husband who refuses to drink decaf can t tell the difference and loves this stuff as with any culinary adventure be sure to have your mis en plis everything in it s place before you start because it can get nerve racking finding the proper spoon et cet in time before the coffee cools the coffee can get cold really fast so i don t use the warmer on top because it is way too wimpy even after the minute suggested time when i m ready to start the machine i place my coffee cup in the sink and continually fill it with hot water until the espresso is ready to pour i use i am not a paper cup because it s glass and insulated as soon as i pour the first shot into the coffee cup i place the lid on the cup to keep it warm while making the second shot a lot of this seems like common sense but when you make your first cup common sense can unravel pretty fast i fill both sized filters and have them ready to go before turning the machine on also i use a small clear plastic bin shaped like a shoe box to keep all the utensils in so when i m ready to make an espresso i just need to pull out the bin and get going i also use one of those cheap thin flexible plastic cutting mats to make everything on so when i m finished i just rinse it no messes to clean up my oz shot glass does not fit under the portafilter so i removed the stainless plate and sit it right on top the grey plastic works fine this way i don t see the need to wait minutes for the warmer to heat up as it does not seem to affect how hot the stream of water is it only takes about a minute or two for the green light to come on once you hit the on switch thank god i could not wait any longer for a machine to heat up so turn the machine on st and once you have all your stuff in place the machine is ready to go be sure to measure out your milk first and have it sitting next to the machine before you pull your first shot some people make their froth first some espresso i don t know the difference yet i m just trying to keep the drink as hot as i can for as long as i can you will also have to buy a metal frothing pitcher mine is krups xs i like the wide bottom so the froth has more area to fill before it reaches the top of the frothing nozzle on the machine so here s what i needed to buy that does not come with the machine oz shot glasses1 milk froth pitcher1 cheap double sided metal tampercheap espresso pre-ground coffeehigh end pre-ground coffee espresso groundskim milkhere is what i keep in my mise en plis

needed another stick vacuum for downstairs to catch the seeds that my bird drops from the cage i decided on buying this one instead of another linx because of the hand vacuum that comes together which is pretty handy if i was going to buy the linx stick vacuum plus the linx hand vacuum it would end up way expensive compared to this one here my list of dissapointments regarding the presto the bin is way to small different from the linx that you just push and the bin opens on bottom dropping all the dirt and dust straight to the trash can the hoover presto not only the bin is small but it s painful to empty first you need to remove the hand vacuum after that you remove the bin from the hand vaccum and after that you manually pull the cover of the bin which is a little wall with the filter the suction linx suction is better and stronger of course we can t compare if a heavy corded vacuum i noticed that part of the reason the vacuum catches the seed is because of the brush when the brush catches the seed the heavy ones such as the sun flower seeds it keeps rotating with the brush until it is moved to the middle where the vacuum suction open is so if it isn t the bush you would have to aim the vacuum opening to catch it i also tried a little tiny piece of rock of a size of the sun flower seed the rock spinned with the brush i could see and hear and suddenly it stopped i thought well it catched and went to the bin as soon i turned off the vacuum and lift to take it back to the charging station the rock just felt back to the floor at the time the bin was empty so the suction must to be on its best performance once the presto drains the battery you need to put back to the charging station and wait for the next round to continue to clean different from the linx which has a removable battery so for the linx i have two battery if one goes out i just get the other that is sitting on the charging linx is selfstand so if you are going to take a break you can just leave your linx standing in any place for the presto you need to find a wall because it doesn t stand by itself like any other decent vaccum after all the cons i got i believe the hand vaccuum that comes with the presto is not a great advantage specially if the suction is not that great', 'bh20090'], 1412: ['this is a really good mattress i was really skeptical when i purchased this mattress how

use the great thing about this foot warmer is the heat is gentle without being utterly useless it s amazing how much warmer my entire body feels just by placing my feet on this mat not hot to the touchi leave it on for hours at a time and it never overheats or gets too hot to touch which is vital for me given the limited sensation on my lower legs great with or without slippersi often keep my feet inside my slippers and then just place my feet on top of this mat while reading playing with my tablet or just sitting and watching tv we have hardwood floors so they can get pretty cold in the winter even here in sunny california i ve tried cranking the heat up in the house but that does little to help cold lower extremities it would literally have to be as hot as a sauna in here to start

all drug stores nearly all supermarkets and here at amazon but a lot more expensive here it s under two dollars a pint at wegmans and several times that price here mineral oil is also what s used to protect wooden cutting boards rolling pins spoons etc mdash any wooden article that regularly comes in contact with moisture mdash so there are plenty of other uses for it around the kitchen it s perfectly safe in contact with food in the quantities used it has no color or taste or smell and it never gets rancid or gummy which all vegetable oils do eventually', 'atlas wellness pasta'], 1564:

simplifies things compared to boiling water on the stove a good electric kettle is much faster and simpler this krups kettle is well built and does a great job and compared to heating water on a gas or electric stove top it takes only a fraction of the time it s important to remember though that the more water you add to your electric kettle the slower it will boil if you only want to make a few cups or a small pot of tea then only fill the kettle with the small amount that you need the smaller the batch of water the more efficient this will boil compared to boiling on a stove top similar to the time savings from a microwave less is better this kettle is great for other uses too if i need to boil a big pot of water for pasta or potatoes i can fill half of the water in the pot on the stove and boil the other half in the kettle splitting the load in half like this reduces the overall time to boil the water if you live in an area with super hard water like i do make sure not to leave any water standing in this kettle because it will create lime and calcium buildup the simplest way to keep this clean is to immediately pour out any of the unused boiling water and then leave the lid up the heat in the kettle will evaporate the rest of the moisture out and leave the inside completely dry and while you might be tempted to wash it after use think about it first it was just full of boiling water so it s pretty sterile in there washing it with soap and water and a possibly gunky sponge would almost certainly make it less sterile than it would have been if you just did nothing but

piece selling here at amazon for with free shipping under the title clear glass percolator top fits farberware etc by fits-all i have not received it yet so we shall see if it really fits all a couple of reviewers mentioned other alternatives as far as the complaint re the lid being too tight true but if it was not people would be pouring coffee all over the counter and themselves the coffee is very hot so use caution in terms of the spout hole being too small bull it pours out just fine thank you very much when it comes time to wash it just allow it to cool down and then twist and pull the lid not too difficult getting back back to the stainless steel parts it is extremely sturdy and solid i saw other percolators reviewed where customers complained of the thin metal used some were selling for as much as the farberware classic stainless steel yosemite cup that i bought was only and the only other well built percolator that i ve seen was so a very good buy here ladies and gentleman it brewed wonderfully but i have some tips wash it with warm soap and water before you use it for the first time rinse extremely well otherwise your coffee will taste strange if you have trouble putting the lid on just make sure that the basket with stem is in the middle before you close the lid it is true that one has to place the percolator handle away from the burner toward the counter so it remains cool use coarse coffee grinds and wet the basket well before you place the grounds in the basket you won t get any particles in your coffee once brewed if you have an electric stove don t go above an if you have a gas stove use a medium-sized flame do not walk away and forget about the pot it brews quickly so there is a potential for the pot to brew dry and catch fire for best results wash the pot lightly after every use so there is no buildup inside the pot or basket the oil buildup makes coffee taste weird after awhile lastly i used tablespoons for cups and the coffee was a little weak i will use double the amount next time that should solve the problem but i am still in the experimental stage hope this helps follow-up the glass top mentioned above fits perfectly make sure that the metal ring is placed on the inside of the pot lid before you thread the glass top into it i do not like mud-coffee so i find that tablespoons of coffee to cups of water

rapidly when turned on its side the lid also pops off if you put too much weight on the container because it has a collapsible base weight causes the bottom to push into the food and pop the lid off the lid is also labeled as not microwave safe what when i see something made of silicone i expect to be able to use it to heat up my food in the microwave not so with this the second limitation is the built in spoon fork this two-sided utensil snaps into a slot in the lid for easy transport while it s a great idea to build a spoon fork into the lid for easy carry the actual spoon fork is very flimsy you won t be able to cut through food any better than you can with a cheap disposable fork the spoon side has a capacity of teaspoon this is less than half the capacity i measured of a typical table spoon the spoon is so flat that you will have an easier time using it to spread peanut butter than using it to actually take in anything liquid then again it is so flimsy it might not work for spreading peanut butter either the lid is the real deal breaker for me because i am always worried about spilling food on my clothes or car seat i will go back to using my trusty pyrex they are heavy and not compact but they last a really long time work well in the microwave and for the most part don t leak the only reason i didn t give this star is because it is bpa free and it would work for

wasn t cutting it i started looking around and simply could not justify five hundred bucks for a vitamix the reviews on this one were pretty good so i thought i d give it a try i m so glad i did the number one reason that i have hated using a blender is the clean up you have to take it all apart and clean each piece what a hassle this blender is one piece you don t have to take it apart at all i m serious when i pour out my smoothie i rinse the jar under water and it s ready to go again this will absolutely make a huge difference in how often i use this blender my second favorite feature you kind of have to try to understand and it is such a little thing that you may think i m silly for mentioning it but i marvel every time i pull the plug that s because there is a hole in the center of the plug that your thumb or finger naturally slips into and makes pulling the plug the easiest thing ever now i know pulling a plug has never been a big hassle or effort nothing you d have to plan your day around but this is so cool and intuitive i don t know why someone hasn t thought of it before i showed my adult son and he was unimpressed until i urged him to pull the plug he smiled and said someone is going to make a fortune off of this i know but i had to tell you about it okay more stuff you might care about it has some automatic cycles the only one i have tried is smoothie obviously i think it would be good if you were using all fresh not frozen ingredients and no ice it s not really sufficient for a smoothie with carrots or frozen fruit this leads me to another feature that i really love there is a timer on it that turns off automatically at seconds wait you mean i can hit liquify and walk away heck yeah you can watch me cause i just did seconds on liquify is perfect for the smoothies i make i literally have a minute to put all my ingredients away and wipe the counter when the smoothie is done so am i pretty sweet the lid fits nice and tight it has that little ring on the top that makes it easy to get off the feeder hole is different than you are probably used to i would be hard pressed to describe it but both the plug and the surrounding collar are hard probably the same acrylic that the jug is made of and the plug clicks into place the feeder hole is average sized oh i almost forgot the way that the jug fits onto the base is pretty sweet no more twisting the jug this way and that to try to figure out how the darn thing is supposed to fit on there it s the same way every time four grooves and ridges each at a quarter of the way around the jug slide together easy peasy now the motor and all of that well that s above my pay grade but i have to say that the base is super heavy and solid the blender seems to have no problem blending carrots nuts and frozen fruit i haven t tried ice but i can t imagine there would be any issues there either i am just as happy as i can be with this purchase i wish i could give her more than five stars update i had the chance to see a vitamix demonstration at costco and taste the result there were three things that the guy was really promoting as special features of vitamix the first was the base blade structure so that you don t have to take it apart to clean it the breville has the same thing he also kept pointing out that he was able to blend a variety of things without adding water i drink lots of water and think that is a good thing so i m not sure why it would be an advantage to not add water finally he was saying that the consistency of the smoothie was unlike any other machine s i found it foamy or thick airy and less pleasant than what i am used to with the breville while i have been thrilled with this blender there were questions in the back of my mind because of course

flirting with getting a new vacuum for some months i had looked at the dyson line but balked frankly at the price point ye gods and little fishes i couldn t get past it but thanks to imitation being the sincerest form of flattery there are a great many vacuum manufacturers who are incorporating dyson engineering or design elements into less pricey alternatives my previous hoover model u5456 dates back to and with the exception of an indicator light that had died within a month of owning it i have had no problems never affected the way the unit worked as far as i can tell i was more than willing to give a hoover cyclonic a try the uh72400 is a windtunnel with a bagless cyclonic canister it has a smaller foot print than my old hoover and is quieter this led me to wonder if it was cleaning as well but no it works just great you do empty out the canister far more often than you change out a bag but this is a little thing accessories the uh72400 has exactly two accessories a combination upholstery and crevice tool and the hose handle the hose handle combination looks like it was taken directly out of the dyson playbook except that the machine end of the hose must be manually switched into a suction port the working end can be released and pulled out of the body as just a short handle or longer tube to suck up small debris but the full handle is not a telescoping variety it turns out to be six inches shorter than the full accessory handle on my old hoover and i could not reach cobwebs in ceiling corners or curtain rods as easily the old accessories fit though so i could extend my reach but still no where to conveniently store them on the machine even if you had any you could add on canister the canister has a hepa filter and a washable filter i ve been hand washing my old vacuums filters for years just be sure they are bone dry before you reinsert them the hepa filter you don t wash just knock the excess debris from it one button empties the canister but unless the contents are heavy it will need a little jiggle to flip open fair warning do not shake the canister empty with a twisting motion to get debris out when i did this the canister filter assembly neatly detached itself from the twist on top and handle and fell into the garbage can in a cloud of vacuum dust shake it up and down perhaps a little side to side carefully but no twisting that was a mess they could probably stand to put a small friction point where the canister connects to the top to make it even slightly less easy to pop off unexpectedly during emptying cleaning head it s surprising that the windtunnel hasn t changed much in years the rotary brush is more or less the same but there are some differences the new unit is a lower profile and rides low easier to reach under furniture or under cabinet doors unlike my old one it does not have an adjustable height but is supposed to auto adjust happily this means it also flings less cat litter around when vacuuming stray litter from around the cat area but i have no idea how well this will work on a lose pile carpet like shag so s but still can be found in the wild instead of a foot switch you just pres down the entire cleaning head the rotary brush engages and off you go operation the unit has an electronic on off pushbutton which means it doesn t stay depressed once pushed on and the only way to tell if it s on or off is if the motor turns on when you plug it in on the flip side because the rotary brushes in the windtunnel head do not engage while the vacuum is in the fully upright position you aren t likely to accidentally suck up the cat or anything the maneuverability is a vast improvement over the old hoover and twisting the handle during operation easily changes course the unit is less cumbersome and a bit lighter than the old one so i could actually lift it and use it on stair treads dog beds and seat cushions bottom line i ran my old hoover over my rugs vinyl and hardwood flooring saturday four days later i ran the new hoover windtunnel air over the same surfaces and got an impressive or depressing depending how you look at it amount of fine dirt and debris in the canister either i generate that much dust and dirt in four days or my old vac wasn t cleaning as well as i thought my old hoover had a two year warranty and needed two belt replacements and had a broken led in years no major issues the windtunnel air comes with a year warranty which i naturally haven t needed to test out as yet but my past experiences with hoover have been positive at this

for this i could not get it to work well with a firm tamp i messed with the grinds over and over and decided to just give it a very very light tamp and that seemed to work perfect for some reason when i remove the basket it is filled with sloppy runny water coffee and not a nice dry puck as it should be i may be doing something wrong i am not sure the manual sucks and has quite a few mistakes in it

what do you expect i will keep updating my review as i progress amazon is great and damn near the only place i buy anything anymore i gave it stars because the shot is good and the price is right

itself the oxo corer and divider has the handles essentially flush with and in the same plane as the main body of the tool the raised handles provide additional leverage and force when pressing down to core and partition whatever it is that you need to process into eight approximately equally sliced portions i also find that the calphalon slicer cuts more cleanly through the skin on apples while the comparable oxo tool frequently requires some additional help after the fact push through with fingers or other tool to completely separate the skin when coring thus the calphalon tool makes this

maker by our old friends mr coffee it was a cup but not programmable that was fine with us it is nice looking but not huge like many of the automatic ones it s black shinny design is attractive and has the water level on both sides of the front we liked that and it was cheap less than so we decided that the ones we had used before cost over and another would buy four of these if they didn t last over a year each since both of the expensive ones we had died in that time now we normally buy just about everything from amazon com but we couldn t go without coffee for even a few days so we bought it right there out of the box it s as simple as it gets we followed the directions in washing and cleaning before using i actually did the procedure twice just to make sure our first pot tasted great in fact coffee from this basic brewer actually tastes much better than the coffee made in the two expensive brewers we had before go figure and we love how simple it is to use fill the reservoir to the desired height put in a filter swing the steam arm over the filter close the top securely hit the switch and within a few minutes pipping hot coffee that tastes pretty darn good and after you re done when the brewer has cooled the carafe and the removable filter holder wash up easily in the sink we had lots of cone shaped filters from the other coffee makers and didn t want to waste those so we are able to flatten the bottoms of the filters and they fit just perfect in the filter holder the instructions advise not to place a hot empty carafe on cold or wet surfaces they aren t pyrex so i imagine they would crack easier than in the past we just put a hot pad on the counter to let the empty carafe cool before washing we also unplug the mr coffee after each use due to an increase in kitchen fires from all small appliances in more recent years this works out fine since there is no computer or clock to reprogram we ve only had the mr coffee cg13 cup coffee maker for a week how long will it last we ll see and i ll write an update if it dies before a year or if there is any other issue but if you don t use all the fancy preset programming in a coffee maker and just need something cheap that makes a decent cup of coffee you may want to consider this brewer update november the carafe is more fragile than earlier warned about my wife just tapped it on the metal sink and it shattered so be very careful with the included carafe or you ll have to order a replacement which is half the cost of a whole new unit', 'cg13'], 1947: ['well done needed a grinder that really grinds

crippling affliction which i have so if this piece of junk doesn t work for people with normal hands don t expect it to work for anyone else i often search for items that will help me and that can also be adapted for other purposes after overlooking this particular jar opener numerous times because it reminds me of similar poorly designed models that i ve seen at sears and dollar stores i decided to give it a test run it was definitely a bad decision i should have listened to my intuition length largest jar opening a deceptive smallest opening a deceptive i say deceptive because that is what one perceives while the opener is attached to its cardboard retainer you are also deceived into thinking that the grip is an inch deep when in truth it s only less than half an inch as the inner part of the opening grip loses of hold making it fit unevenly over any jar you try to open causing slipping and perhaps harm to your hands in short it s more than junk it s a catastrophe i ve read and written enough reviews to know old reviews for a good product could remain at a website long after the manufacturer decides to skimp on quality and produce an inferior model the retailer or manufacturer s associates paid reviewers and friends might also submit reviews that are less than truthful so the reader reads an excellent review and ends up with a lousy product i ve seen such deterioration with fiskars scissors the vitality toothbrush and a pentel pen somehow i suspect that this jar opener was always terrible for arthritic hands and in order of preference i ve had good results with the following jar openers the wrench strap style called power grippower grip jar opening system from handy trends pack as seen on tv i bought a small long nameless version of this junky easi-twistjar opener at the dollar store that has a single inch opening and it works very well on small jars i also use it to turn my entrance doorknob where it works very well my third choice is the zyliss zyliss strong boy handheld jar opener which i had to play with for awhile before i figured out the trick to keep it from slipping once i managed to solve that problem it works as well as the power grip eventually i ll buy an electric jar opener and give it a test drive i almost forgot the old gilhoolie twister jar openertwister jar openerwhich i loved when my hands were good it s an excellent product that has been around for about a century varied from the original design but still great for people without arthritis and perhaps those with mild arthritis another good product for

iron on cotton shirts since the steamer never really removes the puckering on the collar button placket and the cuffs i ve used a steamer for years both at home and in my job as a production manager i had no issues assembling the steamer the poles fit together nicely but as other have stated one was hidden within another easy to pull out though but only if you know it s there here are the things i really like the press support is a brilliant addition and one that should be on every steamer in my opinion it slides up and down easily and perfectly supports the clothing since the press support backs up the fabric there s less of a chance of hands getting burnt the wheels are smooth and the tilt back operation makes for a comfortable and easy relocation the footprint is about the same as my old steamer although it seemed larger on first glance the poles telescope down easily for storage the covering on the hose offers a little more protection from heat than plain plastic the plastic nozzle handle does get a little hot but not too hot to the touch adding water is simple and the tank fits firmly without spillage it heats up in less than seconds my old steamer took much longer probably three to four minutes the accessories lint pad fabric brush and delicates steam cap are nice to have i particularly like the delicates steam cap for scarves the not so good the clips are a little hard to manage since they re under the thick plastic top hanger it s particularly hard when they re all the way out to the edges clipping the garment on when they re closer together and then spreading them helps it s too short i m but when my pants are clipped on they hang over the hose connection at the bottom it has to be much worse for taller people i ve added some photos above as an illustration some hints i usually hang my clothes right out of the dryer and don t want to take them off the hangers and then put them on the clips or the built-in hanger i also find the hook to be too low so i glued on a hook near the top of the unit and can hang my pants or shirts from that i ve attached a photo of that as well it s best to steam items hours before you plan to wear them or

and you get a nice crisp and attractive glow coming through the ribbing looks how a ribbed item should look and not like a glass items with fat lines in it i m ticky about ribbing while it still displays seams like it s siblings the kufra rolly jugs these seams blend in and do not mar it s pretty looks both the rolly kufra seams are offensive to the eye i was a pleasantly surprised that the viva jug is slightly more slender than it s counterpart kufra jug great if fridge shelf real estate is hard to come by in your kitchen although the viva is supposed to be about ozs smaller than the kufra i find that hard to believe i did not measure but when i was washing them both out i poured all but a wee amount from the kufra to the viva jug slimmer size for the smaller portion size is great trade-off the only drawback i can see and this is for all the bormioli rocco jugs that i have tried is the handle while it is a nice sturdy handle and fits perfectly in my petite hands those with bigger paws might not find it as good of a fit if you have a big pawed manimal think kill bill hands then they ll have to use the finger method hopefully they have the muscle to back up those large paws and i mean biceps ladies unlike the kufra which has an abrupt angle in it s rounded ball shape to allow for grabbing the viva does not the jug s symmetry flows and is more aesthetically pleasing for some reason it is slightly more comfortable too my knuckles always hit against the angle on the kufra unless i grab it perfectly and align the hand for maximum grasping comfort who has the time i would not hesitate to recommend the viva jug it is pretty enough to set out on the table for a brunch bbq or lunch for guests whereas the kufra is so utilitarian it would best be kept for the family brekke these are so well priced and stylish i plan on buying a few and giving as hostess gifts a jug with some lovely flowers or in a basket with some home-made simple syrups vodka gin pretty herbs and the party will be a smash or at least your host will be lol amazon is a bit higher priced on all the bormioli rocco jugs so keep your eyes open you can find it at an even better price i would still have no problem paying full price for this but why when you don t have to all this gushing over how nice it is i forgot to mention that the viva is a substantial piece of glass like the others and i would not hesitate to make hot tea in taking precautions of course the viva seems slightly lighter than the kufra which i have made hot tea in tons of times with no problem i ll let you know if i run into a problem later down the line when making hot drinks in the viva this is so cute and casual it will actually look really cute and give a sort of countryfied look to your table if you just left your silverware in the pitcher tip throw in a large stainless serving spoon or several pieces of tableware in a pitcher glass to help draw heat from the glass to avoid cracking your pitcher glass works a treat also the large glass stirrers from a martini pitcher works well too unlike the crooked spoon another reviewer received my stirrers have been perfect looks really cute with different colored stirrers too if you happen to have a few martini to go packs made up that have plastic stirrers they fit perfectly while adding some pizazz update still loving this value priced pitcher am

a pound bag of bread flour and a giant package of yeast and have now made loaves in the past days as well as sourdough starter their basic sourdough recipe is amazing the bread is chewy and elastic

their rice cooker another one of god s greatest essential appliances trust me and it has this special measuring cup too anyway buy this bread machine if you don t like it return it or sell it but you

everything that happens from start to end and when to add items and show a moving arrow along this line also have the screen have built-in recipes to follow and if possible maybe an auto-dispenser for the add-on items so you don t have to wait around so far i think i ve made loaves of bread i bought a lb bag of bread flour at costco but also bought bags of flour on amazon grain and whole wheat and it took me two loaves to realize that you still use cups of white bread flour for every cup of whole wheat or multi-grain unless you want very very very dense bread i find if i add items as soon as

another kitchen appliance years ago we d been given a full size food processor and never used it ended up giving it away we finally decided we needed to get one because we love hummus and it is so much cheaper to make than buy and the blender just wasn t the tool for the job searching for small processors the cuisinart stood out for the number of high ratings of it i looked at the smaller ones but caught a comment along the lines of you can t really use more than half the volume while it looks like you can fit a lot in the processing chamber and they call it cup capacity the blade sits over an opening that is about half the total height so if you ve got a lot of liquid it is going to flow right through and out the bottom of the chamber this is the biggest food processor we would want to store and it turned out to be the perfect size for us the brushed stainless plastic housing looks fine i d rather not pay for real stainless steel for a product that is kept behind a cabinet door it was packed well and came with a small plastic spatula which at first looked like a throw away item but turns out to be just the right size and shape to get nearly all the processed food out of the chamber not having used other food processors i can t compare this one s functions to others i d imagine that a full size model with a more powerful motor could do more but for us this is a good compromise the first batch of hummus the users manual included a recipe for hummus which varied from my usual one so i gave it a try and it is good was all it took to confirm we had made a good choice

t do a very good job ironing or they end up tearing up on me i grew up with my mom s heavy heavy metal iron that iron did a great job i think the sheer weight of it just smashed clothes flat nowadays most irons are lightweight my husband knowing that i loved my mom s metal iron bought me theblack decker f67e the classic iron with aluminum soleplate steam-surge button i used it and liked it quite well but then i dropped it and busted it i m hard on irons apparently so then i got theblack decker ir03v easy steam iron it was much more lightweight but still did a good job because it steamed really well but now enter the rowenta autosteam dw4000 the rowenta autosteam dw4000 is a very large iron and it is quite heavy which i m use to so that doesn t bother me and i actually kind of like i feel like heavy irons work better on clothes when the iron has a little weight to it the handle is large in my hand i have small hands and i thought that would be a problem but when i use the iron i end up not noticing that and it wasn t a problem but i mentioned it because that could cause a little hand fatigue for some standout features of this iron watt ironthe unique shape of the tip of the ironthe vertical steam featuredrawbacks spits a littlei used this iron to do a whole week s laundry and even though i m a slow ironer it zipped through the laundry pretty fast because of the aggressive steaming i used the autosteam feature which adjusts to whatever setting you have the iron on ie cotton and it puts the right amount of steam out for cotton articles most of the clothing that i was doing was either cotton or cotton-blend it did a good job of ironing but i have to say that it did exceptional job of steaming it puts out a lot of steam it does hold a lot of water but i did have to refill after every few pieces of clothing because it just uses that much water up with all the steam that it puts out i did get a little spitting but that is pretty common in irons that i ve used in the past and it didn t matter that much to me i am steaming the clothes anyway so a little spitting didn t really cause that much of a bother if i was ironing something that i didn t want wet i wouldn t be using the steam feature anyway on dry ironing it did an average job the steaming here is the standout on this iron i also really liked the narrow tip of the iron it was easy to work in and around collars and buttons the iron has a safety feature which is pretty common now in irons it automatically shuts off after minutes if it s left on its heal and after seconds if left on it s soleplate i did not have any problems with this my last iron had that feature too honestly i don t leave my iron down on it s soleplate anyway unless i m using it and minutes left on it s heal is a pretty long time it s plenty of time to adjust clothing or grab a new article of clothing the instruction book is terrible it contains illustrations and not instructions honestly on some of it i m not sure what they are trying to tell me it also has a self-cleaning mode and it recommends that you set it to self-clean every weeks overall i liked the iron quite a bit i thought that when i got through with my laundry that the clothing looked exceptionally crisp and looked better than my old iron made them look maybe the high amount of watts and amount of steam gets deeper in the fabric i was also able to get some creases out of my husband s denim work shirts that had seemed to be in there permanently on the tails of his shirts where he tucks them in this is my first rowenta and it certainly

has a brushed finish my existing pans everyday stainless version had a mirror finish which while attractive took extra time to maintain because they would show hard water spots one couldn t set them on a dish drainer to dry the exterior had to be hand dried right away to avoid spots in addition some of them had been dropped on to a ceramic tile floor which caused dents and scratches since

encapsulated aluminum steel disks that said they held up very well the exterior mirror finishes were still stunning and the interiors still spot freethanks to barkeepers friend the only major negative were the rolled hollow handles which got hot during cooking and which often required the use of mitts to handle the pan given that i was upgrading i was willing to spend in the area of and was hoping for clad cookware all-clad at for a full set was out of the question i did consider the piece french tri-ply set which is made in france which was priced about more than multiclad pro however that set had only one saucepan and yet two frying panssince i use saucepans more frequently than frying pans i d prefer more saucepans and fewer frying pans there is a larger french tri-ply set with extra saucepans and a pasta insert for the stockpot but it was priced up in the low s in addition there was the issue of the exterior finish french tri-ply and also chef s choice has a mirror finish whereas multiclad pro has a brushed finish my existing pans everyday stainless version had a mirror finish which while attractive took extra time to maintain because they would show hard water spots one couldn t set them on a dish drainer to dry the exterior had to be hand dried right away to avoid spots in addition some of them had been dropped on to a ceramic tile floor which caused dents and

mrs spudman recently had shoulder surgery so i ve been doing all the lifting from stovetop to countertop resting the hot pans on wooden cutting boards you can use metal with these pieces but we prefer to use wood or plastic utensils we also try to be careful when storing the pieces in a cabinet using kitchen towels to separate each piece even with the care we take eventually the pieces suffer scratches on the outside this is our second experience with the autograph coating and it holds up very well on the anolon site which has lots of good advice and recipes the user is advised not to use cooking spray on the nonstick surface and not to cook at high heat degrees plus we also never put any of the cookware in our dishwasher but wash with warm soapy water and a kitchen sponge never steel wool other thoughts we like the comfortable handles on this cookware the feel sturdiness and the shape of them they are also made so that you can hang the pieces if you would like the lids are also thoughtfully designed handles are firmly attached to the lids that fit securely with metal rims that preclude leaking or overflow from the edges one piece we would like to have is a four quart two

reviewing their manual hand crank juicer i jumped at the chance it arrived in a few days and i selected some apples and carrots to give it a test my first impression was that although it s totally made of plastic it s sturdy very well made and designed to last i cleaned the counter top and dried it well and then suctioned on the base by twisting the dark green ring it suctioned very nicely and i got to work with the apples i manually cranked while pushing with the tamper and watched the juice come out in one cup and the pulp ooze out the end i didn t peel or pre-cook them just cored and sectioned them and still the juicer did a great job with them the juice was cloudy as natural apple juice is and had small specks of pulp in it but this was exactly what i had hoped for next i juiced the carrots this took more time and elbow-grease but again i got a nice portion of cloudy-with-a-little-pulp carrot juice in one cup and dry pulp in the other one the suction base came loose a couple of times during the carrot experiment which is the only complaint i have about the juicer i quickly suctioned it back on the counter top and had my husband push the tamper on the carrots so i could hold the base of the juicer steady the whole unit cleaned up easily with soap and water and overall i m very pleased that i had the chance to try this juicer in future generations of this product it would be nice to have a clamp to use on tables or counters in place of the suction base but i recommend this juicer to anyone who likes low-tech or who wants to save the electricity and space needed

found a home in the room next to the kitchen that also has a sink the walls there are dark wood so it looks very cheerful i like the removable water reservoir it makes filling the coffeepot with exactly the right amount of water easy it also makes cleaning easy the gold filter is one of the best i ve used usually i find them hard to clean but this one is smooth and wipes right out since we have septic i have to be careful to keep the grounds from going down the sink the other glod filters i ve used have not been as smooth and hard to clean adequately so far the coffeemaker has worked

of having to hover the kettle over the base unit just right before seating it on the base unit it sounds like a nitpick but remember this kettle when filled to capacity weighs almost lbs that s quite a bit of weight to have to maneuver to get the kettle seated right there are other problems and pluses here s a complete pros cons evaluation of this kettle pros insulated double-walled constructionthe doubled-walled construction has two advantages i it makes the kettle cool touch when boiling water in the kettle the exterior of the kettle is warm not hot so you don t risk getting

blue led indicator turns off and the kettle automatically shuts off there is also an audible click as the power button pops up good looksi do find the audacious boxy look very attractive and refreshing cons slow boil timesit boils liter of water the maximum capacity in minutes seconds i actually timed it boil times will of course vary depending on altitude and the initial temperature of the water narrow openingthe opening of the kettle is an oblong rectangle with rounded corners measuring x the narrow opening makes it a little inconvenient to fill it with water and to clean in

another key advantage is if you purchase a pair of these they are sufficient to equally split a ml bottle of wine without overfilling beyond the point where the carafe starts to flare out at the neck if you were to fill past that point the wine will not open as quickly so in effect this is a perfect design for enjoying a half of a ml bottle alone or purchasing two for sharing that bottle these are

kneading it with the dough hooks at the slowest speed to my surprise it had plenty of power to work the dough after several minutes the dough was sufficiently kneaded and passed the window pane test mission accomplished it has an internal fan to cool the motor but at watts it doesn t get very warm on the counter next to it is a hobart-era kitchenaid k5a it weighs at least two tons which i can only run for a few minutes before it gets quite warm and i wind up turning it off so it doesn t overheat kneading with the sunbeam is actually quicker because you don t have to stop it wait for it to cool down and start again you can t put this mixer on its stand turn it on walk away and come back to kneaded dough because it won t get all the dough that way the trick is to take it off the stand and use it as a hand mixer you can then guide it by hand to get all of the dough it is plenty light so you don t mind the weight and the process goes quickly much faster and less laborious than hand kneading even at the slowest speed it seems like it s running faster than it needs to and would probably benefit from a somewhat slower speed but in use this is not a hindrance it has a clever way of ensuring that the correct hook goes into the correct receptacle removing the hooks is a little fiddly but no big deal the stainless-steel bowl is three quarts if you need a larger capacity you could get a bigger bowl note that this model does not come with wire whisks it comes with regular beaters and dough hooks i don t know if the regular beaters could beat an egg white or whip cream and i don t know how the mixer would perform with stiffer ingredients such as cream cheese cookie dough or lower-hydration bread dough with whole-wheat flour you can probably get whisks from sunbeam after the fact for my purpose of kneading bread dough i am quite satisfied with its performance the housing and stand are made of plastic but this is not a drawback for the home user i m not sure i would use this in an industrial setting such as a bakery restaurant or cafeteria for the home user it s perfectly fine and costs a fraction of the price of expensive high-end mixers i do have reservations about

saw this new oster versa i couldn t help myself i had to give it a whirl let me cut to the chase it s a very good design and well executed and a good value in today s market i do have one small quibble which i note below and for that reason i am only giving it three stars for now revised to five stars see below for my first test of the versa i had peeled and cored two large apples a thick skinned variety sonata from wa state to make an apple sauce fruit compote to top banana ice cream so i was looking at that small pile of roughage on the cutting board and thought why not so into the versa went skins seeds stems and cores with sufficient water to see whether it could emulsify tough vegetable fiber as well as a vitamix i have a vitamix but it s not at this location so to be fair this is not a direct comparison my impression was the versa might have taken a bit longer than a vitamix and maybe didn t do quite as good a job but better than any other less expensive blender i ve tried but who blends apple core skin seeds and stems for breakfast not me so then i decided to give it a real world test for that i made a nut seed milk using teaspoons of flax seeds and teaspoon each of chia seeds sunflower seeds goji berries quinoa almonds and pumpkin seeds all in raw state harder to emulsify but arguably more nutritious raw flax seeds are the toughest to emulsify in a blender most will leave them in some kind of partially whole state and you might as well not bothered adding them i mixed on low for a few seconds and let soak for a few minutes before blending which is what i would normally do making a seed nut milk base for certain smoothie recipes i m happy to say it passed this test with flying colors again not in direct comparison but i would say the result was as good as i would expect from a vitamix bottom line is i m keeping the versa for use in my second location i do have one small quibble however when i first tested the tamper with just water in the blender i noticed it was just barely long enough to reach the top two blades at first i thought i must be doing something wrong because the tamper should not be long enough to reach the blades and how could oster s engineers have got wrong something so obvious well i don t know the answer to that but i double checked what i m doing and as far as i can tell yep the tamper is just a wee bit too long resulting in little black plastic flakes in the blender carafe i m sure if it is a production glitch it will be ironed out quickly my machine came from a big box store and was likely from the first production run i called oster customer service who suggested i return it to where i bought it with an explanation and order another directly from their own warehouse which i did for the time being i will give it stars until i figure out if it s something i did or just an early production glitch i ll update this review when i know more meanwhile bottom line this really is an excellent blender at a very competitive price it s good looking too imho the versa might even cut into vitamix sales a bit it would not surprise me one bit update i received the replacement yesterday and it s all good news the tamper issue is fixed the problem in my first sample came down to the lid it allowed the tamper to reach down further into the carafe and reach the blades on the new lid the part that stops the tamper from going down further is just a teeny bit higher i m going to assume this was a one off problem or worst case an early production glitch that won t affect anyone buying a unit now or going forward anyway the tamper issue is almost a non issue for me because i use the tamper so infrequently anyway impressions after using everyday for a week it s all good news i like it more after using it let me compare it a little further to the vitamix the best blender i ve used yes i feel vm is the better blender on an absolute basis but the versa is a better value for most people the reason is even the least expensive vitamix is basically a commercial grade machine over specd and overbuilt in every way for example the vitamix carafe has much thicker walls than the versa it s effectively impossible to break whereas it looks like the versa carafe might crack if you dropped it on a tile floor and it hit on the wrong angle another example the vitamix motor base is considerably heavier than the versa s and seems to me has considerably more power on tap also that might be the reason the versa motor is protected with a soft start circuit it ramps up to full power over a second or two the vm can go from dead stop to full power at the flick of a switch and it has the torque to do that pretty much no matter what you have in the carafe these are features that cost more but don t add anything to daily use for most people the versa to it s credit has borrowed many of the better design ideas from vm but it s not a clone there are some intelligent trade-offs that make it a more cost effective design for average users if the vitamix were near the same cost as the versa sure i d get the vm every time but it isn t enter the versa it s the blender choice for folks who would choose a vitamix other things equal but were stopped by price', 'oster versa watt professional'], 2519: ['i have enjoyed the benefit of clean filtered air in my bedroom now i live in a semi-arid area in

eggs and the perfect tool for fish because when you push down it flexes and the blade goes flat on the surface of the pan push forward and the spatula slides easily underneath the food it has just the right curvature superb design the edge of the blade is beveled with a rather sharp edge that only serves to make this spatula even easier to use to slide under food the handle is comfortable to hold never becomes hot when held and the edge never scratches non-stick or metal pans this pelton tool is dishwasher safe the slotted design allows oils and greases to leak through as all slotted spatulas do i would never be without one i am spoiled by it after all this time the exoglas composition will resist melting to about degrees f so the edge never melts at non-crazy heat as the years cycled by i came across some kitchen products recommended by america s test kitchen and cooking illustrated same company owns both by the way i noticed that this pelton spatula was rated number one by them above all other available spatulas that made me smile oh how i agree with them you can order in red green-gray or blue per the offer here you will receive just one spatula not all three colors as shown in

provided you understand what you re getting here s what you need to know this is first and foremost an espresso machine using the milk frother you can also make cappuccinos caffe lattes etc however to do so is not as easy as it is with some of the other machines out there eg the nescafe dulce gusto where you just insert an espresso capsule and than a milk capsule to make a cappuccino with this system you need to take the extra step of frothing the milk separately which creates a little more work both in terms of preparation and clean-up that said the quality of the espresso and the freshness of the frothed milk are worlds better with the essenza machine and frother than with any other system i am aware of and the frother is excellent by far the best i ve seen nespresso s website sells a large variety of esspressos lungos etc while i don t care for them all the ones i like are far superior to any i ve tasted from other pod coffee-makers eg nescafe s dulce gusto and the various k-cup systems i doubt any serious coffee connoisseur would be unable to find an excellent coffee to suit his or her tastes in addition the decaf espressos are also surprisingly good this is not a cheap system the capsules cost approximately each which is probably far more than you re used to paying if this replaces a standard drip brew coffeemaker the cost of milk etc is however far cheaper than similar quality coffee that you might purchase from a coffee shop such as starbucks upshot it s worth the investment if you take your coffee seriously especially if you would otherwise be paying or times the capsule cost for a cup of joe at your local coffee shop nespresso s customer service is excellent unlike some of their competitors such as nescafe nespresso is very responsive to customer e-mails for example when i purchased this item i contacted nespresso after discovering that one of the whisks included in the frother was missing within an hour or two they e-mailed me back to tell me that replacement whisks were being shipped to me nd day mail at no additional charge this was a deal-maker for my wife and me unlike many pod systems the nespresso capsules are recyclable through their various distributors in our neck of the woods this means sur la table while this requires collecting your used capsules and taking them to sur la table on a semi-regular basis my wife and i find this to be no great burden if only because we are often looking for a reason to visit sur la table in the first place overall if you are looking for coffee reminiscent of the quality you may have

heavy for me the size can be both a pro and a con the bigger size means it can clean a wider path and it means not having to empty the dust bin often on the other hand it is heavier and harder to store hoover addressed the storage issue with a foldable handle very useful according to the description it is only pounds but it feels heavier than that to me it is harder to push than i expected possibly because of the strong suction i m not very strong and i have some shoulder and neck issues and this vacuum causes more shoulder and neck pain than other vacuums i have used it doesn t matter what floor setting i put it on it is still very difficult to push on both hard floors and my area rugs most people probably wouldn t have as much of an issue as i do it is very powerful it picked up stuff that my other vacuums left behind i only had to empty the dust bin twice while cleaning my entire house the second time was after i d finished vacuuming and there was still plenty of room in the bin at that point i just didn t want to store it with dust and dirt in there this vacuum seems louder than others but it s difficult to tell for sure perhaps the louder noise is due to the greater suction power it has a washable filter plus a carbon filter to prevent bad smells this vacuum was designed with pets in mind so something to prevent odor is probably a good idea it comes with different attachments geared towards picking up pet hair also both seem useful but i ve been using the crevice tool more than any other it is strong enough to pull the dust clumps out from under furniture without having to put it all the way under the flexible hose is fantastic and easy to detach and reattach the attachments are all stored on the vacuum itself which i also like a lot the crevice tool stores inside the extension wand to save space the retractable cord has to be my favorite feature of all though i don t know why every vacuum does not have this feature it is also a nice long cord pulling the cord out is easy the lever for pulling the cord back in is at foot-level so there s no bending down required for this and it is strong enough to pull the cord back without having to help it along at all the pedal for turning on or off the brush-bar is also easy to operate with a foot and the power button is on the top of the handle when the handle is locked upright the brush-bar remains off however as soon as you lean the handle back to start vacuuming the brush bar always turns on if you re on hard floor you have to push the lever to turn it off every single time i would prefer if the brush bar would stay in whatever state it was in when you turned it off there are settings for floor type of them but i haven t really noticed a difference when vacuuming my area rugs i ve tried all settings including bare floor and it all felt pretty much the same to me and cleaned the rug just as well i haven t had to clean the brush bar yet but i think that this will be very annoying once i have to do it there are screws that have to be removed in order to get the brush bar out overall i am impressed by this vacuum it has great suction and great attachments and features my biggest concern is the weight if you are strong this vacuum cleaner is perfect and it s value priced pros retractable cord2 nice flexible hose3 easy to attach detach tools that all store

smell is expected when the unit is heated for the first time the instructions recommend that you plug it in and heat it up until the smell dissipates we followed these instructions when we brought the unit out and plugged it in to use it for the first time we had a perfectly functioning unit with no surprises the instructions also explain that this unit is strictly for keeping cooked foods warm when placed into the chafing pans the food should already be fully cooked and hot i used all three of the stainless steel quart compartments one had baked potato wedges in it one had turkey and stuffing in it and one had crispy baked dressing in it everything stayed warm moist and yummy we started out with the unit turned on high and placed the potatoes and crispy dressing directly out of the oven into the compartments once the turkey was carved and the stuffing removed we placed those items in the third compartment and then turned the unit down to low where it stayed until dinner was over and we turned the unit off i could not have been happier with the performance of this appliance it performed exactly as i was hoping no more stress about timing all the various aspects of the meal so that everything was hot when we sat down to eat other things i particularly like are the way the lids are made the way the handle is molded into the lid makes the lids easy to remove and

my youth seeping throughout the house but not browning waffle batter since it smelled closer to the odor of an overheated lionel model train transformer and only by happenstance did that scent not morph to the smell and smoke of could have burning batter as the only other control on the grill is the ready lamp after pouring on the requisite sacrificial first waffle it was evident trial and error sessions would be required to determine how much and how long to leave the batter browning since a temperature control switch is absent as well based on the ready lamp alone the waffles were a bit too mushy for me and for what it s worth didn t brown consistently either on the positive side the grill plates have a secure looking system and at this point clean up easily assuming they were pre-oiled before use however i wouldn t attempt to remove any crusted residue with a steel brush as suggested because i don t have a great of confidence the whatever it is coating is going to go the distance under any set of circumstances the plates are also promoted as dishwasher safe but based on size and my lack of confidence with them hand washing is the route i will take in those limited

become very familiar with the roomba and have come to expect a certain ease of use and ease of maintenance i m also impressed with how easy it is to get new parts every few years when something in the roomba wears out maybe it s the gold standard i don t know what i do know is that i can get a new one for about and the techko maid is currently selling for about regardless i got the opportunity to test the techko maid rv318 i jumped on the opportunity because i ve been thinking about getting a second roomba anyway i have a largish dog and a decent sized house the combo makes for a busy robot vacuum so what all is wrong the biggest problem first the techko maid rv318 gets stuck easily very easily my roomba simply powers over things that hang up the techko maid things like throw rugs and floor mats the techko maid can navigate some of them if it hits them at the right angle but eventually gets stuck as it is i ended up following it around and unsticking it i got tired of keeping it unstuck so i started writing this review even now i can hear its little wheels spinning uselessly as it is stuck trying to climb onto a throw rug the roomba cleans that rug every day the dirt bin is tiny and doesn t do a great job of isolating the dirt the techno maid ran for about minutes before getting stuck opening the dirt bin cover revealed that a decent amount of dirt and dog hair had somehow migrated up onto the top of the bin the migrating dirt isn t a huge deal as long as it doesn t get into the motors which i haven t checked the tiny bin is a big problem maybe the small bin is ok for an apartment dweller with no pets it isn t ok for me as for actually picking up dirt and stuff from the carpet and tile it did ok when it wasn t stuck not great if it ran daily the floors would eventually get clean i guess in any case the roomba does a far better job of vacuuming stuff into its much larger dirt bin the techko maid does not have a docking station but must be plugged into a

juicer on amazon i went oooooh pretty all that shinny metal so even though i currently have a working all plastic hamilton beach juicer i got this one for one i was hoping it would be easier to clean than the hamilton beach which has tons of nooks and crannies that have to be washed what a pain i wanted to love this machine but one thing after another made me not want to use it the first thing that surprised me was that i couldn t take it apart by myself i had to call for someone to hold the base while i struggled to remove the top that contained the mesh and blades once i took it apart i washed it from top to bottom i was pleased to discover that it had less nooks and carnies so it was easier to wash good but when i looked closely at the spout that is a metal tube placed inside a plastic tube i notice what looked like soap bubbles no matter what i did i couldn t rinse the bubbles out but just in case i was wrong and it was some sort of glue i decided to wait and see if the bubbles went away when everything dried yup they disappeared it was soap bubbles this made me think of two things would minute traces of soap be transferred to my juice as i used the juicer and more importantly would juice get in in-between the plastic and metal and cause a bacteria problem design improvement just a one piece spout like the less expensive versions or if the spout was designed so i could take it apart wash it separately there is a rotating cap with a hole at the end of the spout that you can spin to stop drips when you have to empty the measuring cup once again nice idea bad concept when i rotated it the first time i noticed bubbles there if soap can get trapped under the cap so can juice which could cause a bacteria problem the bella comes with a pretty metal and plastic measuring cup that has a lid that fits over the spout nice concept but again bad design the metal has a cutout so that you can see the juice as it fills plus it has cup measurements on the plastic insert nice idea but once again when i ran water over it i hadn t even started to wash it i looked inside the cup and noticed that water had already seeped in between the metal and the plastic when i turned it upside down water ran out onto the counter i don t want soapy water running into my juice if i wash the cup before using i figure the only way around this is to be sure that your cup is dry before using it doable but not optimal design improvement use a one-piece either plastic or metal cup now i will be the devil s advocate and say there is a chance that i got a lemon and the seals are normally much tighter it s up to you if you want to test this theory better-yet i suggest you try the cheaper bella juice extractor it avoids all the problems outlined above conclusion rather than

size thunder group rolling pin which is the one i ordered in i first set up house keeping and wanted a rolling pin as good as my mother s hers was wide and about in diameter all wood and most importantly it had ball bearings i had a very very small budget but i found a x birds eye maple one with ball bearings at an affordable price with my sears employees discount it was a rich color and had a nice shiny varnished finish it is still in perfect condition because i never lent it to anyone and no one ever used it except my husband who is a great lover of all things wooden if they are also inanimate and he treated it gently as proven by his delicately flaky pie crusts well except once in when i caught him using it to roll down seamless flooring where he d put down too much adhesive i nearly had a coronary even though he had thoughtfully wrapped it with waxed paper in near shock i threatened him with bodily harm if he damaged it in any way it was only years old then he didn t damage it so i had no excuse to replace it but i still always remembered my mother s bigger diameter rolling pin and how much more easily it rolled things out and still pined for a larger one through the years i have looked at rolling pins and good ones always seemed too expensive especially considering there was absolutely nothing wrong with mine except i d always wanted a bigger one so when i saw this one i decided to go big the length of this rolling pin is for the rolling surface only in years past i have seen the stated lengths of rolling pins include the handles i saw that this one had really long comfortable looking handles and that the listed diameter was i was not thinking about how heavy this inch by inch well made wooden rolling pin would be when i opened its packaging i was reminded of a cartoon i saw many years ago where a woman was chasing a man presumed to be her husband with a rolling pin this rolling pin would be a very good weapon that is if you can pick it up and wield it with one hand i am not sure if its source thunder group is in anyway meaningful but i bet if you conked a cloud with this rolling pin that you d get thunder it is heavy and don t get it unless you have a good table surface to work on because it will be more trouble than it is worth on conventional depth kitchen counters so what do you get first the actual diameter is over possibly it is difficult to measure because the handle is in the way and i did not pay enough attention in geometry class to convert the circumference into diameter no instructions for the conversion please i also purchased the casabella silicone rolling pin spacer bands casabella silicone rolling spacer bandsto use with it to be able to roll out scottish shortbread dough exactly thick the spacer bands are rated for rolling pins up to however because the thunder group rolling pin is larger in diameter than the spacers do not want to stay upright on it but rather they want to flip down flat i believe if i put one of the less tall ones on either side of the spacers that that will solve the problem as only the ones seem to have the problem i don t know if the silicone will get stretched out in time or not but for as often as i will be using them probably not next it does not say what kind of wood the rolling pin is made of by the weight i am would guess oak but i m probably wrong with old age comes muscle and brain weakness and it does seem really really heavy the surface s finish is matte and at first i thought it was raw wood but i do think it has some kind of finish because some doughs are sticky and raw wood would be a really bad idea for a commercial rolling pin if you are looking for a commercial grade large rolling pin consider this one it will not disappoint you if you don t need

does not have a place to store the solution would need you to wet the cloth a lot easy to clean parts and a nice storage for the particles that is easy to clean5 charge time is under hours but has a run time of just under hours the bumping around the furniture is not that noisy but we closed the door to the room whilst it was cleaning minuses compared with neato it is not an intelligent robotic vacuum ie it does not scan the room to see where it has cleaned it will just bump around the furniture so if you have a lot of furniture in your room may not get all cleaned or you need a few charges to increase the probability of the room being cleaned the neato will go back to its base for recharge and then picks up where it left off this doesnot do that and hence will stop where ever it is once it s juice is out this means you need to be at home to recharge it whereas the neato will recharge and finish the whole floor whilst you are out and about for the price this little robotic cleaner

which will work at camp sites during power outages and in any other no-electricity situation all you need is a solid surface to suction the juicer to and a strong arm to crank it with we ve used a variety of blenders juicers over the years one of our favorite systems to use is a blendtec blender but we paid around for that at a sam s club and that was a huge investment for us not everyone can afford to pay that much for a juicer this chef s star juicer is literally less than one tenth the price and it won t burn out or have an electronics failure it will simply keep grinding here s how it works you suction cup the unit to a completely flat surface it s critical that the surface be quite clean and perfectly flat for the suction cup to hold we haven t had any issues at all with the suction cup when we use it on this type of a counter there s a saw-tooth-edged spiral that you turn with the crank you put the food into the hopper and then use a pressing tool to squash that food against the turning teeth this means with one hand you have to be pressing down quite hard on the food and with the other hand you have to be turning the crank the turning spiral rips through the food and mashes out the liquid this might be easy with a watermelon and far less easy with tougher items my boyfriend is a sturdy hockey-player-shaped man with substantial arm strength he can get the machine to grind through all sorts of things we tested this unit quite thoroughly and he could take on carrots celery you name it i am more a yoga type i find it quite challenging to get the food to mash while turning the spiral if i hadn t been testing this i would have gone for the blendtec every time of course the blendtec needs electricity so it s nice to have the chef s star around as a backup and i do appreciate the eco-friendly aspect of not using electricity while the chef s star is dishwasher cleanable you do have to take it all apart to put all the pieces into the dishwasher and sometimes there s little food bits left in corners of it with the blendtec you simply toss in some ice whir it and it s ready to go again you don t even have to dishwash it again though not everybody can afford a blendtec for people on a tight budget who want to juice and make smoothies the chef s star is a quite functional option i have videos of the chef s star in action to show how it works but really it s straightforward mash the food against the turning screw the liquid comes out the rest squeezes out separately dry this next part is a preferential issue of mine this device is a juicer that s what it s meant to do it does it well the pulp comes out fairly dry but to me that s the issue i think pulp is good fiber is good the idea of stripping healthy fiber out of apples celery and other items and to drink the fructose-water that s left doesn t make a lot of sense i d much rather blend the raw materials and have the fiber and nutrients go into me i suppose there might be very specific reasons that someone might need a pulpless liquid maybe for a recipe but for most cases i would highly suggest people take in the blended version of the food rather than the sugar-water version still again it s hard to hold it against a device that is a juicer that it is indeed a juicer so that part doesn t impact my review at all so to summarize it does what it says it does it does that efficiently it does take substantial arm strength it works with no power it s fairly easy to clean it s quite inexpensive it s sturdy i ll give it a stars with the one caveat that you need to know it needs arm strength if you don t have strong arms it might be better to go with a plug-in version and just accept that during no-power situations you have to stick with softer fruit veggie

easily enough to heavily smoke for hours and either the chips or chunks both work this thing put off an amazing amount of smoke what i suggest is if you are smoking for hours or more soak the wood for minutes prior to starting it so they don t burn up too fast put the smoker box in one of the back corners of your grill if you have a hot spot put it directly over the hottest spot of your grill then turn the grill on high all the burners max out hot as you can get it with just the smoker box inside and no food let the grill preheat like this for minutes which will start the smoke really rolling you have to get the grill really hot to get the smoke rolling which would be too hot to smoke your food so you do it in a preheat style next open your grill and cut your burners to low except for the one directly under the smoker box which you leave on high note you ll have to play with this the first time or to see what combination of burners on low medium off maintains the right temperature for most things on my horizontal burner grill i leave the back burner under the smoker box on high the middle burner either on low or off and the front burner off then i place the meat on the front of the

meter and automatic functions are also very interesting the appliance measures the quality of the surrounding air and gives you a little readout about how bad it is my husband and i had a little bit of fun testing it by breathing on it and it definitely works his breath trips it more than mine does in case anyone was wondering p when set on automatic mode the air purifier pushes more air the worse the air quality around it is which is very good for when you want to keep the air clean while at the same time saving power i have found that the last few days i ve had to keep it constantly on a higher setting though so your results may vary the controls are well designed both attractive and very intuitive without any raised buttons that can gather dust and be hard to clean the filters were very easy to install and thus i d assume easy to replace the replacement filters aren t cheap but for someone like me who suffers so much when the air quality is bad the cost is worth it the only real

scales to analytic balances they all have their strengths and weaknesses here s how the smart weigh rounds out strengths sleek design built in timer more home scales should really have this function this is the perfect scale for brewing coffee with a french press weaknesses the display is slow to update especially when taring there s a second lag between pressing tare and it actually displaying it s not very accurate especially the higher weight you go i compared this to other scales and the smart weigh was consistently off when i went over grams whereas the other scales were in line with each other for home use it probably does not matter much we re talking off by grams when weigh a couple hundred grams there is a calibrate function so that might help but i haven t done it weight varies depending on position on platform while i initially liked the hole handle i ve come to realize that it is a detriment for accurate weighing an item that touches the hole can display inaccurate weight since the platform is rather small even weighing a french press will contact the hole also depending on where the item to be weighed is place you will get different readings that can be off by a few grams even if it s not touching the hole overall i do like the scale despite its inaccurate readings i m willing to tolerate the errors in return for the sleek design and the built in timer just

the bottle there is a ridge beneath the lip of the opening from which its original cap can be wired on with a grip that won t fail this stopper exploits that little ridge the wings on the sides have a groove or ledge visible in the picture when closed down over the outside of the bottle s head that curved edge will grip the ridge beneath the head making a positive clamp that won t come off until you want it to inside the cap of the stopper is a silicon rubber seal with a big spring behind it push down on the stopper and the seal covers the top of the bottle it doesn t go down inside it like a zyliss-type stopper the spring provides the pressure to keep the seal tight on the bottle but the whole thing depends on those wings clasping the head of the bottle to keep the cap clamped down tight and so the spring transfers the force to the silicon rubber seal which holds in the gas if the bottles were under very high pressure the gas would push the cap which would rise against the spring and release the pressure until the spring could overcome the pressure of the diminished gas and would hold it down again but the pressures of champagne and bubbly wine drinks are not sufficient to raise the cap it takes a bit of force on your part to hold down this device but the wings fall in place naturally so it goes on quickly and easily it just needs the initial push to get it down in place very well-engineered stopper and one you can buy with certainty that it works but with one caveat it fits most champagne bottles but some say it doesn t fit them all i haven t seen those it doesn t fit do not buy it for wine bottles beer bottles coke bottles etc there are better stoppers for these the thing is this stopper just might work on many of your wine bottles coke bottles etc but you can t be sure without trying it the key if the bottle has a flat ridge encircling the top underneath the pour spout and if that ridge is pretty straight without chamfers and rounded edges then this stopper may be able to clasp it tip to use this stopper on most bottles of the type being discussed just put a rubber band around the wings so that they can hold on better to the ridge under the lip of the bottle but on the bottles for which it was intended no extra tricks are necessary it will hold tight until you remove it shooshie', 'winco'], 3270: ['warning this filter package is not a viable alternative

company picnic or a club function etc the hinge and handle don t seem to be made of thick enough plastic to withstand a lot of repeated heavy use but for typical home use it should be fine it s not

then used until it went dead as recommended now i run it several times a day for about days until i hear it slowing down before i put it back on the charger overnight i empty at the end of those days and i wash out the filter about every th time which makes a huge difference i plan on buying an extra filter so that i don t have to wait for it to dry by the fireplace and have another on hand as with a clean filter which is easy to take apart and clean the power is so powerful i don t even have to touch the petfusion smartgrip cat litter mat just hold the vac a couple of millimeters away and it sucks everything up the only thing i would improve upon is i would be a locking device on the available extender as when it does touch the floor it pushes itself in which is aggravating to me

wait to write a review until i can give an honest opinion now if it lasts i ll really be ecstatic', 'chv1510'], 3281: ['since step one is to make sure the lithium battery that powers the cordless vacuum is fully charged right out of the easy to open box i plugged one of the two included batteries into the charger unit the first charge only took about minutes to get up to capacity so it was clearly charged before it left the factory but when fully depleted the recharge took almost three hours so plan accordingly while in the charger the battery has three blue lights that indicate the portion of the minutes is depending upon whether one power two or three of them are glowing this is convenient if only a quick fifteen minute clean-up is necessary so waiting for the battery to completely charge is not mandatory and although i plan to keep both batteries fully charged i am overly cautious about leaving the charger continuously plugged in both because of electricity usage and because cause mishandled lithium batteries can explode so i will check before vacuuming to ensure they are still both up to capacity the only assembly needed is to insert the handle into the unit and slide in the charged battery the instructions are clear and although it is always a good idea to read the user guide between the detail on the box and the unit itself it is not absolutely necessary select carpet or hard floor by depressing a button and on the opposite side press the power button to begin i used the machine on a medium pile berber carpet and ceramic tile flooring a quick tap with a foot on the head of the unit and it is released and freely swivels tons of maneuverability and since the head is only eleven inches across it fits into most spaces between furniture legs etc the height of the head is two and a half inches so it is slim enough to get under most couches and other tight spots not having a cord tethering the user to the vacuum permits more freedom than imaginable and shortens time spent on an unpleasant but necessary task to test the actual run time for the lithium battery i used the vacuum until there was no more power completely out of gas the manufacturer claims minutes per charged battery but mine ran for minutes and most of that time it had the carpet brush roll in use which it seems reasonable to assume consumes more juice than the basic hard floor setting so minutes run time per battery seems to be a reasonable claim there are two handles to grab one on the end of the long handle and one on top of the dirt canister the handle on the canister provides the best one-handed grip but for added security grab both handles i weighed the unit on a shipping scale with the battery in place and it is almost precisely ten pounds this model comes with the pivoting dusting tool which has a soft brush on one end and can be angled in two separate spots to create a customized arc other tools are noted in the user guide and if not currently available probably will be soon on the manufacturer s website some of these accessories may be included with other models included in the list are additional reusable filters brush rolls upholstery tool soft dusting brush three different crevice tools a rubberized hair lifter dual-edged lint lifter and a dual edge dusting brush emptying the canister is easy but of course take care while dumping the contents to keep vacuumed dirt contained it is great to avoid the expense of vacuum bags but i miss the dirt containment of disposable bags the fact that the filter is reusable is another consumer friendly design just rinse it out every uses squeeze out excess moisture and let it dry overnight before reinserting the biggest negative i encountered is that the head did not get as close to the edges of the wall as necessary to do a thorough cleaning so to reach that area will require an extra step which is the sole reason i am rating this vacuum four stars and not five one of the crevice tools not included with this model will certainly do the job for the time being i m using the handle attached to the suction hose which works adequately also while vacuuming the pivoting dusting tool kept dislodging from its storage spot on the canister so i finally just removed it until needed and replaced it when done vacuuming my last vacuum cleaner had the exact same problem with an extension wand that simply would not stay attached to the base unit i am otherwise completely impressed with the performance of both battery length and suction strength this is a powerful vacuum and very lightweight so it is easy to carry up and down stairs and use for extended periods of time without fatigue', 'bh50140'], 3282: ['the display is unlit until you press a button and then you get a very

black and nothing seemed to clean it out i filled the steamer with water let it heat up took aim and blasted through the creosote like it was nothing the black soot disappeared and started to drip right off the wall i was really impressed with the power of the steam blasting out of the nozzle it doesn t hold a ton of water but it is a handheld device so this is no surprise the steamer is easy to maneuver has an easy to use trigger and i never felt like i was going to accidentally burn myself in addition to the steamer you get a ton of extensions and accessories like a jet nozzle extension hose triangular brush and a bunch of various scrubbers and smaller brushes these accessories can be used directly on the output or on the end of a hose as well the only issue i had is that the carrying case is essentially an open bag and given the huge number of accessories it would have been nice to have a way to keep everything organized other than that it is an excellent value with a lot

self-destructed it was not useable at all i went on cuisinart s website and ordered a replacement bowl another arm and leg plus an additional arm for shipping i waited a week and heard no news about shipping so i called the item was on backorder but cuisinart did not notify me of that nor does their website specify in-stock and out-of-stock items so i took the part number in my order confirmation

order confirmation from cuisinart didn t even contain the full part number so i re-ordered the correct bowl from cuisinart again knowing it was still on backorder after a week i called for a status

shrinks to a manageable length for storage my shoulders are somewhat sloping so the strap kept sliding off instead i just carried it around by the handle with my left hand while directing the hose attachment with my right i could easily roam my small apartment vacuuming up those weird awkward dust-collecting spots at will it s quite light if you only have a standing vacuum this will be especially handy it s more of a slight improvement on my canister vacuum but it was still considerably easier to work with the telescoping tube is very well designed and fully adjustable it s great for vacuuming walls high horizontal surfaces not so much because of the angle the brush attachment is perfect for vacuuming the many small panels in my sliding shoji screen doors the one downside as with all brush attachments is that the suction pulls the bristles inward and they eventually block the opening especially if they get a lot of dust and hair not always easy to remove the upholstery attachment works great the one thing this set needs is a non-bristle dusting head something to widen the area of suction a bit from the hose opening but all hard plastic without the bristles i would

including the timer some people seem not to be able to use it correctly so i thought i would clarify here here is how you set the yogurt maker you place the filled cups without the lids in the machine put on the lid plug it in set the timer to the correct time and then and only then turn the button on where the light goes on do not set the timer after you ve turned on the button this will result in failure the timer does not wind down to zero it stays at whatever point you put it at however it does work and it does go off at precisely the time you originally set it to it does not go off early if you set it right the first time according to the instructions above if you like thick yogurt as i do and think that regular yoplait is too thin then set the timer for or hours i know they say that hours is plenty but it s only plenty if you like regular yoplait i don t if you use the hour timer you are bound to get a yogurt shake not yogurt it is possible to use skim or low fat milk if you set it for a much longer set minimum of hours and usually more since skim and low fat milk is so unhealthy however i don t know why you d want to use low fat many doctors recommend avoiding all low fat cow s milk if you choose almond or soy milk set the timer even longer or hours it s much harder to make a good batch of almond yogurt and you will probably have to be happy with yoplait consistency i m not talking about yoplait greek just regular absolute hard and fast rule never unplug it while it s cooking unless you plan to reset it from scratch you cannot just unplug it for a second to use another appliance and then plug it right back in you ll ruin the yogurt unless you reset everything including the timer set it according to number likewise if the power goes off make sure you unplug the machine then plug it back in set the timer for the rest of the cycle you ll have to guess since the timer doesn t wind down and then push start again the best thing to do is just don t mess with it until it shuts off you can leave the yogurt in the machine for a couple extra hours it won t hurt the yogurt i like to make yogurt in the evening and have it done in the morning no you can t eat it in the morning as one reviewer pointed out but i like my yogurt with my lunch anyway not with breakfast if you put it in the coldest part of your fridge it will be ready in a couple of hours this method beats trying to make yogurt in the morning and then desperately trying to stay awake until midnight or am so that the yogurt won t stay in the machine for too many hours after it shuts off i usually take hours for my thick yogurt of course i like it where it doesn t immediately dribble off the spoon but stays reasonably well on it half way between yoplait and sour cream that takes more

grind and on weekends and when i have a hankering for the real deal only french press will do on busy mornings you can t beat the convenience of the automatic drip but when you have a friend over for coffee or are having a festive weekend breakfast the french press ritual is charming and the flavor is coffee perfection i ve had many french press pots over the years from the standard bodum to the solid francois et mimi to a sterling pro to the kona french press since a french press pot is essentially low tech what i ve found is that the quality of the coffee produced is as dependent on the user as it is on the pot although i ve produced the most awful sludge from the most expensive of potsand that s how i know the criteria i use to evaluate a pot are as follows is it intuitive and easy to use is it easy to disassemble to clean does the screen filter out grounds sufficiently is the pot sturdy and attractive could a novice produce a fine pot of coffee does the pot keep the coffee hot for a reasonable amount of time the kona french press performs well in every area although it s advertised as three pieces you don t disassemble the lid the pot is actually two pieces it s very easy to use i grind a third of a cup of beans to a count of twelve dump the grounds in the pot and boil water i pour a little boiling water in the pot and stir with a wooden spoon then add water to the top band replace the top and set the kitchen timer for five minutes the directions on the box call for four minutes and using a tablespoon helpfully provided per six ounce cup a four miinute brew is not sstrong enough for my taste and all my coffee cups are huge so i ll use the measurer for something else a third of a cup of beans is perfect for this size pot imo when the timer ding slowly press the screen to the bottom of the pot make sure the lid is positioned correctly to pour and enjoy two very large cups of perfect coffee there s a little sludge left in the bottom of the cup but the screen performs brilliantly to filter out the grounds there s also a strainer on the lid in case any large bits get by the kona is very easy to clean not finding any instructions to the contrary i ve been sticking it in the dishwasher and it s come through with flying colors i ve never had another french press pot i could do that with yay the glass is thick and well protected by the black bands around the pot i m careful to bloom the coffee with a wooden spoon but i also don t worry about the pot getting sideswiped by a skillet in the sink it s solid the kona is also attractive it s a bit sculptural and i like the black accents i keep it on the kitchen counter and it looks very european and businesslike this pot would be the perfect wedding gift or present for someone you d like to introduce to great coffee a novice could use it right out of the box with maxwell house or a designer blend and be just fine i love using this pot when i m by myself it s the perfect size for me and

alternatives this hoover model caught my eye and i decided to go for it i had owned several hoovers over the years and even though those past models where from the jurassic era back when these things were actually made in the usa i figured that hoover was still in the game and trying to keep its brand relevant with good products i am very pleased and a little surprised by what a good vacuum this has turned out to be no regrets and the price difference between this and a dyson will buy a lot of something else the hoover windtunnel is a very competent and attractively styled dyson like vacuum at an affordable price it may not have the cool going on that the dyson name and products announce but it provides about of a dyson like vacuum experience for about of the price of a dyson that s something worth looking into the history of vacuum cleaners can pretty much be divided into before dyson and after dyson the basic design layout and technology of upright vacuum cleaners had remained pretty much unchanged for decades the motor was housed in the base driving both a rotating floor brush and a multi vane style impeller that created a modest vacuum and pushed dirt into a paper bag attached to the handle dyson revolutionized the upright by placing the motor in the canister on the handle to drive a high speed turbine like vane that sucked air at high velocity into a bag-less enclosure the dyson also revolutionized vacuum styling with clear see through plastics and a number of cool industrial design touches that said if steve jobs and apple made a vacuum cleaner this would be it the dyson also took advantage of its design qualities and patents to charge a very high price premium other vacuum makes scrambled to revise and update their products with dyson like features dyson had taken advantage of technology that was rather generic but that had never been used for vacuum cleaners or used in quite the same way other vacuum makers rapidly embraced the dyson look and as much of the industrial design styling as they could deliver at a lower price and used as much of the general idea of the suction technology as they could without stepping on dyson s patents the hoover windtunnel air bagless upright works extremely well and out sucks so to speak all old style hoover vacuums which pretty much means most all old style vacuums hoover aggressively styled this model to mimic the dyson minimalist industrial design it looks pretty cool and the design trick of making the upright handle do double duty as the removable extension tube for use with the hose and attachments is a great idea the accessory attachments all work reasonably well although i have yet to see an upright vacuum by any maker where the attachment of a hose and nozzle and so forth is really easy the transition from one mode to the next always involves some switching hose routing and attaching etc it will do the job but it s an upright not a canister floor vacuum emptying the dirt collection chamber is quick and easy the unit is relatively quiet the separate on off switch for the motorized floor brush is a great idea i have to say i was really impressed by the amount of dust and lint that it sucked up from a carpet that i would not have thought to be that dirty this thing really sucks but in a good way all in all this is great and affordable alternative to dyson brand

with liquors and it has lived up to my expectations the goal of this product is to provide chilling to your drink without excessive water the surface area provides maximum chilling but melts faster so your drink doesn t get watered down as quickly as if you had used a cup-full of ice cubes the good it s very easy to use and the ice freezes fast pop the dome tops onto the bottoms they fit snugly and then fill with water to the marked line put them in the freezer and in what seemed like a very short amount of time they were frozen peel the tops off and pop the ice balls out into your glass fill the glass with your beverage item of choice the things to watch for don t overfill water expands when it freezes and if you fill beyond the specified fill line ice will expand out through the top filling hole and then freeze down the side this does not cause a huge problem but will likely require you to run a little warm water over the fill hole to melt the ice so you can pop the ball out better to just under-fill and test what works best for you i ve found that filling it to just under the fill-line produces the best quality of product i ve used these over and over again in a short

vacuum is the power button on the handle this is different from what i am used to but it makes using it a little more convenient in addition when turning the vacuum on it seems to propel itself a little which makes using it a little more easier most of my cons could be due to the fact that i have to get used to using a canister vac first off it s quite awkward for me having to drag the canister portion around when vacuuming an area since i am accustomed to using uprights instead this awkwardness may fade over time but i thought i would put that out there for others who may have the same issue at first also as i said before the manual is very poorly written and confusing i m pretty sure i put everything together correctly but without a clear manual to confirm i will always wonder if i really did my wife says she finds it heavy and kind of hard to use she may be referring to the fact that she has to drag the canister behind her which like me isn t really used to as far as effectiveness goes i m not sure if its better worse or about the same as my uprights the dust sensor light is always on in my case and i don t know if its supposed to be doing that or did i put
